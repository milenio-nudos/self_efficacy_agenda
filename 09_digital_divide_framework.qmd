## Digital divide framework

In this section, the ideas of @Lythreatesetal.2022 related to the concept of digital divide will be summarized. This is relevant to address since it provides us with a conceptual framework and bibliography to understand the digital inequalities, potentially addressed in this agenda.

The concept of the digital divide, coined by scholars during the 1990s, refers to the various gaps in access, usage, and outcomes associated with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The digital divide has gained increasing prominence due to the rise of the digital economy; the concept has been embraced by numerous organizations and public policy institutions. For instance, the United Nations places significant emphasis on ICT as a means to achieve its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and combat social inequalities. The significance of the concept lies not only in its impact on individuals' relationships with the digital world but also in its implications for social mobility, given the pervasive integration of ICT into both the labor market and educational systems. Three levels or grades of the digital divide have been proposed, each with its specific characteristics and context.

The first level to emerge was the most restrictive, focusing solely on disparities in ICT access within the population. This was conceptualized simply as a dichotomy between those with effective access to technology and those without.

At the dawn of the new millennium, scholars recognized the need to broaden the concept, as access disparities alone failed to capture the growing inequalities tied to technology and digitalization. The second level of the digital divide encompasses differences in access to relevant content, the quality of connectivity, digital knowledge and skills, attitudes, behaviors, and emotions.

A third level of the digital divide was proposed as a critique of the assumption that equal access and use of ICT would necessarily yield equal outcomes. Consequently, it became essential to examine the benefits or consequences derived from ICT usage.

The concept of the digital divide has been studied through various approaches and a wide range of variables. As a result, it has been proposed to conceptualize it as a multidimensional and dynamic phenomenon, aligned with the rapid pace of technological change in contemporary society.

The most relevant determinants of the digital divide include age, gender, socioeconomic status, attitudes, beliefs, emotions, ICT experience and training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events (e.g., COVID-19).

Moreover, recent literature has proposed new levels of the digital divide. Bartikowski et al. (2018) argued that the type of internet use is a critical component of the digital divide. Cinamon (2020) highlighted data inequalities as a significant but insufficiently addressed aspect of the digital divide. Gran et al. (2021) introduced a new fourth level of the digital divide, which examines the positive and negative effects of algorithms on individuals. Awareness of and access to information about algorithms could become a crucial societal issue, particularly as algorithms assume a significant role in public participation, posing a challenge to democracy.

Integrating this research agenda into the broader literature on the digital divide is essential. Self-efficacy aligns with the second level of the digital divide but is also proposed as a significant predictor of digital skills, directly linked to the outcomes individuals can achieve through digital technologies(cite). Additionally, the Digital Self-Efficacy (DSE) research agenda aims to explore potential gender differences and their relationship with countries' levels of development—a focus that aligns closely with studies on the digital divide. As a mechanism for personal reflection, self-efficacy has a strong connection with learning (and therefore with literacy and skills), particularly in today’s context of accelerated technological change, which encourages the constant acquisition of new skills. High self-efficacy enables individuals to adapt to the dynamic labor and educational environments and to independently learn the knowledge required by current circumstances.
