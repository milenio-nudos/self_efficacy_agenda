    "title": "Digital Self-efficacy. A Research Agenda with an International Large-Scale Assessment Insight",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe Self-Efficacy agenda in digital environments has become increasingly relevant to the changing contemporary world. High levels of self-efficacy enable young people to increase their ability to adapt to new technological environments, facilitating their learning for life in the long term. The concept has even been coined as a second-order digital divide.\nThe research on digital self-efficacy has been extensively investigated, and a large volume of information and data is available. This agenda deploys international studies in the educational field that allow approximations at the country and school level to study the issue.\nAlthough these large-scale international studies have been disseminated and analyzed in countless articles and academic journals, they are generally studied around the problematization of the digital competence or literacy variable, leaving digital self-efficacy in the background. Likewise, most efforts do not tend to stop to compare how all these studies approach the phenomenon of digital self-efficacy in a differentiated manner.\nThe NUDOS social line has the opportunity to open an agenda around digital self-efficacy in educational contexts with an international orientation. This could be beneficial both for increasing understanding of the levels of autonomy in young school children around the world and for amplifying the pace of publications and visibility of the project.\nHowever, to open this agenda, it is first necessary to dive with due dedication into the concept of self-efficacy, how it lands in digital studies, and then how it is taken up by large-scale international educational studies. This paper aims to formalize a research agenda for digital self-efficacy in ILSA studies that will serve as a constant reference for research in the social line of NUDOS.\nFour specific objectives are proposed:\n\nUnderstand Bandura’s theoretical definitions of self-efficacy, as well as its limitations and empirical suggestions.\nDissecting how the concept of self-efficacy was integrated into digital competences discussions.\nCompare how international large-scale educational studies have approached to digital self-efficacy.\nAccumulate evidence on how the digital divide is expressed on levels of digital self-efficacy.\n\nThe manuscript is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter presents the theoretical background of Social Cognitive Theory, explaining how Self-efficacy is part of a deep effort to understand human agency. The second chapter exposes Bandura’s definition of self-efficacy and the concept’s relevance and analytical classifications. The third chapter takes Bandura’s empirical suggestions to measure self-efficacy and then revises the critiques and limitations of his proposal. The fourth chapter describes the relationship between digital competence and digital self-efficacy, detailing how this last one has been studied and theorized. The fifth chapter analyzes how Large Scale Assessment studies have included self-efficacy as a variable of analysis. The sixth chapter compares three specific Large-scale Scale Assessment studies’ approaches to digital self-efficacy—the seventh chapter focuses on discussing their measures and definitions. The eighth chapter explores empirical evidence on how the different levels of the digital divide are expressed in digital Self-efficacy. Finally, the Ninth chapter concludes with methodological suggestions for future research."

    "text": "1.1 Social Cognitive Theory on Psychological Debates\nThe concept of Self-efficacy cannot be understood if it is not revised by the role that has on Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory. This theory emerged to discuss behaviorist and computationalist psychological approaches to studying the human mind and learning process. In particular, this theory tried to focus on the human agency, which the other two currents of thought dealt with reductionism.\nLearning has always been a debate in psychological theory. In the discipline’s early stages, the foundational principles embraced an input-output model of learning. The mechanism that the mind presents was not relevant for the empirical positivistic perspective in the behaviorist current; the objective of psychology was reduced to studying action-reaction phenomena of human behavior. Behind this state, there was an assumption that the mind was a mechanical device, where the stimulations are received invariantly, so the input determines the subject’s response.\nWhen computational thinking started to grow in the second decade of the XX Century, the mind started to be represented as an internal circuit with cognitive operations. As computers, the mind performs complex operations to process information and give solutions to problems presented (inputs). In this way, the mind is a computer operating by pre-ordered rules saved in the neurological network (or hardware). A “throughput” was added to the mind in this second case. The behavioral decisions were now oriented by a process. The multifactorial dynamic throughput computationalist position doesn’t give space for intention or will; opens the mind to learn about problems and make changes in the solution-making process, but it’s a hiper-cognitive approach, which cannot explain decisions by affections, emotions, or imagination.\nFor both perspectives, behaviorists and computationalists, human agency is not present because, to assume agency, there has to be consciousness. The conscience supposes a self-generated purpose in the action. This contemplates not only cognitive operations but also a sense of life of the subject. Bandura’s intention of SCT was to not reduce the conscience activity to an epiphenomenal product of a sub-personal level, either neurological-cognitive aspects or subconsciousness desires. Bandura’s work tried not to ignore human prime features in psychology, such as subjectivity, deliberative self-guidance, and reflective self-reactiveness (Bandura, 2001).\nThen, a definition of SCT can be given: “Consciousness cannot be reduced to a non-functional by-product of the output of a mental process realized mechanical at a non-consciousness lower level”. People act on beliefs, goals, aspirations, and expectations, which are not fully explained by brain or environmental activity. People are agents of experience rather than simply undergoing their experience. We give meaning, direction and satisfaction to our lives. The point is that the consciousness elements can also change the brain and the environment, so they are not epiphenomenal issues. Neurons are plastic to our thinking. We are not only exposed to stimulation, but we agenting acting to it (Bandura, 2001).\nThis agentic perspective fosters a line of research to provide new insights into the social construction of the human brain. Our functional structure changes through our interactions and thoughts. The claim is to “bio-psycho-socialized” the human development. In SCT the mind is not an aggregate of environment or brain. Have emergent properties. The human mind is generative, not reactive. So there’s a double direction of complementation: By one way, integer human intentionality to behavior, for the other, try to limit sociostructural factors and see how it links with psychological mechanisms to produce behavioral effect. This is how Bandura arrives at the Triadical reciprocal causation model of action, where personal/internal factors (organic or mind-intended), Environmental influences and Behavioural patterns have bi-directional mutual determinations between them."

    "text": "1.2 The Elements of Human Agency\nHow can the human being’s agentic properties be determined? Bandura gives some definitions. An agentic act is one that is done intentionally, with a representation of a future course of action to be performed. The intention enables the power to direct and plan actions to achieve the intended outcomes. In that way, to portray agency, the actors have to be aware of the consequences of their actions (Bandura, 1982).\nThe human agency is composed of three elements: Forethought, Self-reactiveness (out-oriented –&gt;), and Self-reflectiveness (&lt;– in-oriented).\nForethought: It’s the temporal extension of agency that goes beyond forward-directed planning. Through this exercise, people motivate themselves and guide their actions in anticipation of future events. This forethought, projected for a long-term perspective, gives direction, meaning, and coherence to one’s life. In simple terms, the ability to bring anticipated outcomes to bear on current activities promotes foresight behavior. It enables people to transcend the immediate environment and fit the present into the future.\nSelf-Reactiveness: An agent is not only a forethinker. They need motivation and self-regulation, too. Agency involves the deliberative ability to make choices, but also to give shape to appropriate courses of action and to motivate and regulate those actions. This is the reactiveness dimension. Refer to mechanisms that regulate motivation, affect, and action by self-referent subfunctions.\nSelf-Reflectiveness: Ability to self-examine own functioning. The meta-cognitive capability to reflect upon oneself and adecquate one’s thoughts and actions. Within this element, people evaluate their motivation, values, and meaning of life purposes. It’s to think about our thoughts."
