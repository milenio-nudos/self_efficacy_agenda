    "title": "Digital Self-efficacy. A Research Agenda with an International Large-Scale Assessment Insight",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe Self-Efficacy agenda in digital environments has become increasingly relevant to the changing contemporary world. High levels of self-efficacy enable young people to increase their ability to adapt to new technological environments, facilitating their learning for life in the long term. The concept has even been coined as a second-order digital divide.\nThe research on digital self-efficacy has been extensively investigated, and a large volume of information and data is available. This agenda deploys international studies in the educational field that allow approximations at the country and school level to study the issue.\nAlthough these large-scale international studies have been disseminated and analyzed in countless articles and academic journals, they are generally studied around the problematization of the digital competence or literacy variable, leaving digital self-efficacy in the background. Likewise, most efforts do not tend to stop to compare how all these studies approach the phenomenon of digital self-efficacy in a differentiated manner.\nThe NUDOS social line has the opportunity to open an agenda around digital self-efficacy in educational contexts with an international orientation. This could be beneficial both for increasing understanding of the levels of autonomy in young school children around the world and for amplifying the pace of publications and visibility of the project.\nHowever, to open this agenda, it is first necessary to dive with due dedication into the concept of self-efficacy, how it lands in digital studies, and then how it is taken up by large-scale international educational studies. This paper aims to formalize a research agenda for digital self-efficacy in ILSA studies that will serve as a constant reference for research in the social line of NUDOS.\nFour specific objectives are proposed:\n\nUnderstand Bandura’s theoretical definitions of self-efficacy, as well as its limitations and empirical suggestions.\nDissecting how the concept of self-efficacy was integrated into digital competences discussions.\nCompare how international large-scale educational studies have approached to digital self-efficacy.\nAccumulate evidence on how the digital divide is expressed on levels of digital self-efficacy.\n\nThe manuscript is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter presents the theoretical background of Social Cognitive Theory, explaining how Self-efficacy is part of a deep effort to understand human agency. The second chapter exposes Bandura’s definition of self-efficacy and the concept’s relevance and analytical classifications. The third chapter takes Bandura’s empirical suggestions to measure self-efficacy and then revises the critiques and limitations of his proposal. The fourth chapter describes the relationship between digital competence and digital self-efficacy, detailing how this last one has been studied and theorized. The fifth chapter analyzes how Large Scale Assessment studies have included self-efficacy as a variable of analysis. The sixth chapter compares three specific Large-scale Scale Assessment studies’ approaches to digital self-efficacy—the seventh chapter focuses on discussing their measures and definitions. The eighth chapter explores empirical evidence on how the different levels of the digital divide are expressed in digital Self-efficacy. Finally, the Ninth chapter concludes with methodological suggestions for future research."

    "text": "1.1 Social Cognitive Theory on Psychological Debates\nThe concept of Self-efficacy cannot be understood if it is not revised by the role that has on Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory1. This theory emerged to discuss behaviorist and computationalist psychological approaches to studying the human mind and learning process. In particular, this theory tried to focus on the human agency, which the other two currents of thought dealt with reductionism.\nLearning has always been a debate in psychological theory. In the discipline’s early stages, the foundational principles embraced an input-output model of learning. The mechanism that the mind presents was not relevant for the empirical positivistic perspective in the behaviorist current; the objective of psychology was reduced to studying action-reaction phenomena of human behavior. Behind this state, there was an assumption that the mind was a mechanical device, where the stimulations are received invariantly, so the input determines the subject’s response.\nWhen computational thinking started to grow in the second decade of the XX Century, the mind started to be represented as an internal circuit with cognitive operations. As computers, the mind performs complex operations to process information and give solutions to problems presented (inputs). In this way, the mind is a computer operating by pre-ordered rules saved in the neurological network (or hardware). A “throughput” was added to the mind in this second case. The behavioral decisions were now oriented by a process. The multifactorial dynamic throughput computationalist position doesn’t give space for intention or will; opens the mind to learn about problems and make changes in the solution-making process, but it’s a hiper-cognitive approach, which cannot explain decisions by affections, emotions, or imagination.\nFor both perspectives, behaviorists and computationalists, human agency is not present because, to assume agency, there has to be consciousness. The conscience supposes a self-generated purpose in the action. This contemplates not only cognitive operations but also a sense of life of the subject. Bandura’s intention of SCT was to not reduce the conscience activity to an epiphenomenal product of a sub-personal level, either neurological-cognitive aspects or subconsciousness desires. Bandura’s work tried not to ignore human prime features in psychology, such as subjectivity, deliberative self-guidance, and reflective self-reactiveness (Bandura, 2001).\nThen, a definition of SCT can be given: “Consciousness cannot be reduced to a non-functional by-product of the output of a mental process realized mechanical at a non-consciousness lower level”. People act on beliefs, goals, aspirations, and expectations, which are not fully explained by brain or environmental activity. People are agents of experience rather than simply undergoing their experience. We give meaning, direction and satisfaction to our lives. The point is that the consciousness elements can also change the brain and the environment, so they are not epiphenomenal issues. Neurons are plastic to our thinking. We are not only exposed to stimulation, but we agenting acting to it (Bandura, 2001).\nThis agentic perspective fosters a line of research to provide new insights into the social construction of the human brain. Our functional structure changes through our interactions and thoughts. The claim is to “bio-psycho-socialized” the human development. In SCT the mind is not an aggregate of environment or brain. Have emergent properties. The human mind is generative, not reactive. So there’s a double direction of complementation: By one way, integer human intentionality to behavior, for the other, try to limit sociostructural factors and see how it links with psychological mechanisms to produce behavioral effect. This is how Bandura arrives at the Triadical reciprocal causation model of action, where personal/internal factors (organic or mind-intended), Environmental influences and Behavioural patterns have bi-directional mutual determinations between them."

    "text": "1.2 The Elements of Human Agency\nHow can the human being’s agentic properties be determined? Bandura gives some definitions. An agentic act is one that is done intentionally, with a representation of a future course of action to be performed. The intention enables the power to direct and plan actions to achieve the intended outcomes. In that way, to portray agency, the actors have to be aware of the consequences of their actions (Bandura, 1982).\nThe human agency is composed of three elements: Forethought, Self-reactiveness (out-oriented –&gt;), and Self-reflectiveness (&lt;– in-oriented).\nForethought: It’s the temporal extension of agency that goes beyond forward-directed planning. Through this exercise, people motivate themselves and guide their actions in anticipation of future events. This forethought, projected for a long-term perspective, gives direction, meaning, and coherence to one’s life. In simple terms, the ability to bring anticipated outcomes to bear on current activities promotes foresight behavior. It enables people to transcend the immediate environment and fit the present into the future.\nSelf-Reactiveness: An agent is not only a forethinker. They need motivation and self-regulation, too. Agency involves the deliberative ability to make choices, but also to give shape to appropriate courses of action and to motivate and regulate those actions. This is the reactiveness dimension. Refer to mechanisms that regulate motivation, affect, and action by self-referent subfunctions.\nSelf-Reflectiveness: Ability to self-examine own functioning. The meta-cognitive capability to reflect upon oneself and adecquate one’s thoughts and actions. Within this element, people evaluate their motivation, values, and meaning of life purposes. It’s to think about our thoughts."

    "text": "2.1 Learning process depends on Mindset\nLearning theories tend to be concerned with the acquisition of knowledge (Cognitive issues) or execution of response patterns (Behavioral issues) to study performance on an activity. With SCT the discipline started to consider also how Self-referents mechanisms affect the acquisition of competence in a determined task.\nAs motivation and affect elements contain the Self-reactiveness dimension of agency self-regulation, Self-reflectiveness is principally explained by the individual’s self-efficacy level. As a part of the intention of human agency, this concept supposes forethought in its structure. In that sense, Self-efficacy is not a self-perception of the ability to execute an action but an orchestration or continued improvisation of multiple skills to manage the ever-changing situation around mastering an activity. Perceived self-efficacy is concerned by judgments of how well one can execute courses of action required to deal with prospective situations (Bandura, 1982).\nThis concept was so important for Bandura because it occupies a pivotal role in the causal structure of development on Social Cognitive Theory as states that beliefs affect adaptation and change not only in their own right but through their impact on other determinants. i) Efficacy plays a central role in the self-regulation of motivation through goal challenges and outcome expectations. ii) Efficacy determines the challenge to undertake, how much effort to expend in the endeavor, how long to persevere in the face of obstacles and failure, and whether failures are motivating or demoralizing. iii) Efficacy beliefs also play a key role in shaping the courses lives take by influencing the types of activities and environments people choose to get into. In synthesis, efficacy shapes the mindset and the environment, crucial for reinforcing the mastery of the activity to which one is dedicated (Bandura, 1995; Bandura, 1997).\nDebating human genetic-environmental determination, Bandura’s Self-efficacy concept states that learning or development exceeds inner capabilities. If one judges oneself as capable of managing new competencies, one can undertake them with better probabilities of achievement. In technical terms, self-efficacy is an internal mediator of the covariation between external or environmental factors and behavior or actions. Also, it is proved that self-efficacy could shape neuron network growth, so it’s a determinant for material-internal conditions of learning."

    "text": "2.2 Lines of information\nSelf-efficacy is based on four lines of information individuals perceive:\n\nMaster experience. Success builds robust beliefs on self-efficacy. Failure undermines it, especially if it occurs before a sense of self-efficacy is firmly established. Inverse with quick results, which easily discourage if a failure appears.\nVicarious experience. Seeing people like oneself succeed through perseverant effort raises the observer’s belief that one, too, can master comparable activity. The inverse token occurs when observing similar people’s failures.\nSocial persuasion. Convince verbally that you don’t have the capabilities to master some given activities. Discouragement to mobilize effort and sustain it by instilling self-doubts about personal deficiencies resulting from other people’s influences.\nPsychological and emotional states. Stress reaction and tension are signs of vulnerability and poor performance.\n\nThese sources of information are not inherently instructive for the individual. The result depends on their cognitive processing of them (Bandura, 1995). This may vary according to the psychological uniqueness of each person. Four mind mechanisms for processing this information:\n\nCognitive processing. Shape types of scenarios constructed and rehearse them. Visualizing failure or achieving goals of courses of action imagined.\nMotivational processing. There are three elements that are used to understand how motivation is shaped. The first focuses on satisfaction with one performance based on personal attributes (Causal attributions/ Attribution theory). The second focuses on benefits or attainments achieved in the activity (Outcome expectancy/ Expectancy value theory). The third is based on a sense of personal progress in mastering the path (Recognized goals/ Goal theory).\nAffective process. Efficacy affects potential threats and situations that are fraught with dangers. It can modify people’s sense of control. As more control is perceived, there is less anxiety about threats and coping with problematic situations.\nSelection process. Efficacy depends on the types of activities and environment people choose to stay. This decision-making process also shapes the environment to increase/decrease Self-efficacy. As low self-efficacy, low aspiration to take difficult tasks, and less aspiration to take difficult tasks and present resilence coping them."

    "section": "2.3 Types of Self-efficacy",
    "text": "2.3 Types of Self-efficacy\nSelf-efficacy is a multidimensional concept that can be explored by different approaches. To propose thematic research around this concept, it’s necessary to distinguish between different types or perspectives.\nIndividual self-efficacy level differ on three distinct but interrelated judgements: Magnitude, Strength, and Generalizability1.\nThe Magnitude of self-efficacy refers to the level of task difficulty one believes is attainable. Individuals with a high self-efficacy magnitude might be expected to perceive themselves as able to accomplish more difficult computing tasks than those with lower self-efficacy judgments. Alternatively, self-efficacy magnitude might be gauged regarding support levels required to undertake a task.\nSelf-efficacy Strength refers to the level of conviction about personal judgment. It also reflects the resistance of self-efficacy to apparently disconfirming information. Individuals with a weak sense of self-efficacy will be frustrated more easily by obstacles to their performance and will respond by lowering their perceptions of their capability. By contrast, individuals with a strong sense of efficacy will not be deterred by difficult problems, will retain their sense of self-efficacy, and as a result of their continued persistence, are more likely to overcome whatever obstacle is present.\nSelf-efficacy Generalizability reflects the degree to which the judgment is limited to a particular domain of activity or not. For example, these domains might be considered to reflect different hardware and software configurations within a computing context. Thus, individuals with high computer self-efficacy generalizability would expect to be able to competently use different software packages and different computer systems, while those with low computer self-efficacy generalizability would perceive their capabilities as limited to particular software packages or computer systems.\nGenerally, Self-efficacy has two ways to be studied: As perceived capabilities for task achievement and as a self-regulatory attitude. Task self-efficacy involves the beliefs that one can or cannot perform a single instance of a circumscribed behavior at different levels of performance. Self-regulatory self-efficacy is the confidence in how one can (or could) achieve tasks in the context of potential barriers. Studies focusing on capabilities usually emphasize the magnitude of the task, i.e., its degree of difficulty or complexity, and the linear achievement of the masterization process. By contrast, studies focused on attitudinal aspects give greater importance to strength to keep self-efficacy levels in difficult contexts. The first approach questions the capability to reach higher and higher levels in the activity domain, and the second focuses on persistance or resistance in the face of adversities presented by an activity (Williams & Rhodes, 2016). Saying in a different way, Schwarzer & Renner (2000) distinguish between action self-efficacy as confidence that the subject can (or could) perform the behavior even when it requires setting goals and planning, and coping self-efficacy as confidence that the subject can (or could) perform the behavior even in the face of initial setbacks or lack of social support.\nSome contributions to this debate suggest five types to classify self-efficacy constructs. What varies across these conceptualizations of self-efficacy is whether the perceived capability to perform the target behavior is to be judged in isolation (i.e., task self-efficacy) or under various conditions, such as in the context of potential barriers (i.e., self-regulatory efficacy), when initiating a new behavior (i.e., initiation self-efficacy), following relapse (i.e., recovery self-efficacy), or in the face of potentially stressful life events (i.e., coping self-efficacy) (Marlatt et al., 1995)."

    "section": "2.4 Several others",
    "text": "2.4 Several others\nAfter these theoretical definitions, it’s important to note the empirical performance of the Self-efficacy variable. Bandura provides a lot of information that could be useful for our studies. First note. Self-efficacy doesn’t have a positive linear direction with performance. An individual with higher levels of self-efficacy could present lower levels of task achievement. The same with lower grades of self-efficacy. This is because performance and learning, as Social Cognitive Theory tries to defend, is a situated process, and this depends on context, personal attributes, or the specific nature of the task the individual imagines mastering. Self-efficacy covariation with competencies is tied to gender, age, the social groups around the environments, and so on (Bandura, 1995). 2\nSecond note. Self-efficacy is not only an important predictor of an individual’s competences, but also of the decisions he or she makes in life. In the formation period, the perception of boys’ and girls’ capabilities defines the careers they pursue or their interests and affiliative preferences. A person’s life path depends on competences, interests, and affiliative preferences, all of which are influenced by self-efficacy, especially on educational experience (Bandura, 1995).\nThird note. Incentives are also important for explaining self-efficacy. In Social Cognitive Theory, interests grow from satisfactions derived from fulfilling internal standards and from perceiving self-efficacy obtained from performance accomplishments and other sources of efficacy information. By making self-satisfaction conditional on a certain level of performance mastery, people create self-incentives for their efforts (Bandura, 1995)."

    "text": "3.2 Critiques of Bandura and others’ proposals\nIn 1984, Cognitive Therapy and Research dedicated a special issue to Bandura’s thesis on self-efficacy. Some relevant scholars commented on Bandura’s theory’s limitations and confusing issues.\nAn article by Eastman & Marzillier (1984) on that issue said that Bandura’s definition of self-efficacy is fundamentally ambiguous regarding the distinction between self-efficacy expectations and outcome expectations. Separating acts (tasks) from outcomes, particularly in complex activities, is difficult in real-life experiences. Many behaviors involve a continuous interplay between actions and their outcomes, making it challenging to assess self-efficacy independently of outcome considerations. The authors express skepticism about the applicability of Bandura’s findings to everyday life, arguing that most psychological issues involve tasks and outcomes that are not clearly defined. They believe this complexity makes it difficult for individuals to assess their self-efficacy accurately.\nThis condition is traduced in empirical problems. The empirical studies conducted by Bandura often assess self-efficacy through tasks that are discrete and limited in scope, which may not adequately capture the broader complexities of real-life situations where multiple outcomes exist. The assessments of self-efficacy in Bandura’s studies do not account for the variability and unpredictability of outcomes that individuals might consider, thus failing to demonstrate that efficacy judgments can be made independently of outcome considerations (Marzillier & Eastman, 1984). 1\nRecent contributions have indicated that the self-efficacy definition’s grey area with outcome expectations also affects its relation with motivational mechanisms of action. If individuals do not analytically distinguish, with utmost clarity, efficacy expectations from expected outcomes in action, it is likely that the degree of agency is mostly explained by the motivations that generate the outcomes rather than by perceived singular capabilities. In that sense, Self-efficacy would be an epiphenomenon of motivation rather than a determinant. However, if self-efficacy and motivation are intermingled, there would be confusion in distinguishing the agency’s self-reactiveness and self-reflectiveness moments that Bandura previously suggested (Williams & Rhodes, 2016).\nAs a result, Researchers on Self-efficacy indicate that the operationalization of the concept needs to avoid assessments that confound the judgments of efficacy and motivation of the action. To rate the confidence in a target behavior, some assessments ask participants whether they would do the action or how confident they are to achieve it. This would be a better strategy than ‘can-do’ scale construction strategies. Kirsch (1995) explains there are two colloquial uses of the phrase can do. One meaning reflects perceived capability per se based on one’s estimation of their actual capability to perform a task (i.e. the original definition of efficacy expectancy as distinct from outcome expectancy). The second meaning reflects motivation based on—in his examples—anticipated “disgust, embarrassment, guilt, or shame”. The second would be a motivation measurement, not a self-efficacy one. The risk is to interpret “I can do [target behaviour]” as “I will do [target behavior]”.\nThe can/can’t do scale approach would be useful if Self-efficacy is measured as task self-efficacy, this is, focusing on the isolated task, with no context o background. But we know in complex activities this becomes difficult, so it’s better to opt for other strategies such as can-do-motivation one (“I could do it if I would like to do it”)."

Anecdotally, for example, there is a whole research agenda that has focused on understanding how individuals’ levels of self-efficacy with respect to their consumption habits could benefit addiction treatment. Likewise, it has been problematized how students’ levels of confidence can strengthen their learning in mathematical matters or the adoption of new languages (Klassen & Usher, 2010; Lenz & Shortridge-Baggett, 2002; Mahyuddin et al., 2006).\nIn recent years, a whole thematic research agenda has opened up around self-efficacy in studies of digital inequalities and opportunities. There are various high-scale studies on these issues that have become relevant to how this concept lands for individuals’ use and adoption of technologies in the XXI century. In order to understand this debate, it is necessary to look at the concept of digital competencies."

Then, International organizations, as public policy scholars, then started to discuss how to approach levels of mastery of digital technologies in individuals worldwide.\nDigital Literacy was proposed as a first agenda to understand individuals’ capabilities with emergent technologies and their applications, principally on educational achievement (Spante et al., 2018). Initially, the studies dealing with digital literacy focused on technical knowledge of technologies, such as software specifications and operating systems. As soon as the Internet began to become an everyday space in social life, studies on digital literacy began to problematize issues specific to the relationship that occurs between individuals in digital environments, i.e., communication and navigation skills, increasing the dimensions to the fully informational part (Falloon, 2020).\nAs the discussion developed, it began to be realized that a question of knowledge or intellect did not mainly determine the development of technological skills, but rather, that it was a multidimensional and heterogeneous problem that brought together issues ranging from the proper use of digital applications to the formation of a ‘mindset’ or attitudinal dispositions towards technologies that would be beneficial for learning how to relate with them. Self-efficacy would be a domain of this attitudinal aspect of technology adoption and learning. As an alternative to the digital literacy agenda, digital competences began to be discussed (Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt, 2022).\nDigital Competence (DigComp) is defined as “the confident, critical and responsible use of, and engagement with, digital technologies for learning, at work, and for participation in society”. It encompasses a combination of knowledge, that is, understanding how digital systems may be used, how they function, and how to judge their capabilities or restrictions. Also include skills: “to use, access, filter, evaluate, create, program, and share digital content”, as well as to “protect, information, content, and digital identities”, and attitudes, including the reflective and critical handling of these systems.\nA lot of scales operationalize DigComp as a unidimensional concept with different significations. As a standardized alternative, The European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens proposes five domains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetence.area\nCompetence\n\n\n\n\n1. Information and data literacy\n1.1 Browsing, searching and filtering data, information and digital content\n\n\n1.

Problem-solving\n5.4 Identifying digital competence gaps\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current operationalization includes Safety and Problem-solving, which are not regarded in the majority of measures of digital competence. The last one, when is studied, mainly addresses solving technical problems. In contrast, DigComp highlights the skill of utilizing digital systems for solving various problems, not being limited to technical error. In this way, problem-solving also includes the aspect of being aware of one’s own competences and detecting competency gaps. Furthermore, competently dealing with risks and safety digital concerns offers an overview of Digital Self-efficacy, which is an important element in explaining the formation of the five digital competence domains. In this way, DigComp emphasizes this variable, which is minimized in the case of digital literacy definitions (Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt, 2022)."

    "section": "4.3 An evolution of the concept",
    "text": "4.3 An evolution of the concept\nOne reason Bandura devoted so much effort and depth to his theory of self-efficacy is that he was aware that in societies with ever-increasing rates of change, it would become increasingly necessary to have individuals capable of constantly acquiring new skills and thus navigating fast and uncertain times with their due capacity to adapt (Bandura, 1995).\nSociety has changed at an accelerated pace in different aspects up to the present day. One of the most rapidly changing areas today is the development of digital technologies. Year by year the devices, patterns and uses of these technologies are modified, which requires users an unfinished learning process. Given these conditions, self-efficacy has become central than ever to strengthen the ability to adapt to new digital environments. Digital Self-efficacy is an important predictor of learning outcomes with technologies, under/overestimation of competences, knowledge creation and acceptance of technological change (adoption of new ICT’s)(@ Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt, 2022).\nHowever, like the DigComp concept, several different approaches have conceptualized self-efficacy in digital environments over the years. The first antecedents of self-efficacy applied to digital issues resorted to ‘Computer self-efficacy’. Compeau & Higgins (1995) proposed this early instrument focused on general computer domains and specific software application tasks. Defined as an individual’s perceptions of his or her ability to use computers in the accomplishment of a task (ie., using a software package for data analysis, writing a mailmerge letter using a word processor), rather than reflecting simple component skills (ie., formatting diskettes, booting up a computer, using a specific software feature such as “bolding text” or “changing margin”). The computer self-efficacy construct was criticized and overcome for neglecting the changing dynamics of digital systems, which extender the digital enviroment over computers. The items of these scales tend to become outdated rapidly (Weigel & Hazen, 2014).\nWhile the increasing importance of interconnection with technologies, the focus was on general one’s judgment of confidence regarding different tasks related to internet use. Internet self-efficacy focuses on what a person believes he or she can accomplish online now or in the future. It does not refer to a person’s skill at performing specific Internet-related tasks, such as writing HTML, using a browser, or transferring files, for example. Instead, it assesses a person’s judgment of their ability to apply Internet skills in a more encompassing mode, such as finding information or troubleshooting search problems. Internet self-efficacy may be distinguished from computer self-efficacy as the belief that one can successfully perform a distinct set of behaviors required to establish, maintain, and utilize effectively the Internet over and above basic personal computer skills (Eastin & LaRose, 2000) 1.\nAlthough this new construct partially addressed the obsolescence of technologies, the set of digital activities was reduced to a particular domain, as is the case with the Internet. An ICT Self-efficacy scale was proposed to comprise Computer and internet tasks on the same construct. ICT Self-efficacy construct considers digital information processing or communication (Aesaert & van Braak, 2014; Hatlevik et al., 2018) and more advanced skills, such as programming (Rohatgi et al., 2016). Although to its new measures, ICT Self-efficacy usually presents unidimensional concepts or focuses on specific application domains (using ICT for work, school, or leisure) rather than competencies applicably for general life domains (Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt, 2022).\nThe Current measures presented have common limitations in various ways. First, they often do not consider more recent frameworks of digital competences, such as the DigComp, regarding their level of generality, the competences included, and their multidimensionality. The DigComp describes digital competences in terms of general actions (i.e., tasks, functions), such as protecting devices or managing data, that can be applied to a heterogeneous group of individuals and are independent of specific digital systems. Most DSE scales are still system (e.g., specific computer software) or technology-specific (e.g., data storage such as floppy disc) and may thus become outdated. Second, critical competence areas, such as safety and problem-solving are often disregarded. Most of the scales focus on the informational, communicative, and creative aspects of the technologies without exhaustively capturing their dimensions of mastery. Third, the term DSE has been used interchangeably for measuring general competence beliefs (i.e., including items assessing self-concept, another competence belief) or actual proficiency. As a result, this has led to inconsistencies in the representation of the DSE construct in the literature. This is in spite of self-efficacy literature offering clear definitions of how measures should be constructed and its well-defined differentiation from related constructs, such as self-concept (Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt, 2022)"

    "text": "4.4 Standar DSE Scale based on DigComp\nUlfert-Blank & Schmidt (2022) suggests that to reach a high-level of research on Digital Self-efficacy, scales have to (1) be theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional measures of DSE, encompassing diverse digital competence areas, (2) cover different functions and tasks of digital systems, (3) be independent of a specific digital system (e.g., Word), (4) be also labor or economical, not only educational-oriented.\nThen, they propose a scale, which is an actual referent on the Digital Self-efficacy Research Agenda. They follow the approach suggested by Bandura (2006) to measure self-efficacy. The scale is formulated generically and adapted to each specific dimension. According to the document, the questions use expressions such as “I am confident that I can…” or “I believe I am able to…”.\nThese questions are customized to reflect each specific competency or task within the digital self-efficacy dimensions defined in the DigComp framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItems\nDimension/Subscale\n\n\n\n\nsearch for specific information in digital environments.\nInformation and data literacy (iSE)\n\n\ndistinguish between correct and incorrect digital information.\nInformation and data literacy (iSE)\n\n\nstore and organize digital content so that I can easily find it again.\nInformation and data literacy (iSE)\n\n\ninteract with others in digital environments.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nshare information and data with others digitally.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nparticipate in public discussions and activities in digital environments.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nDefend myself against injustice in digital environments.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nDefend myself and others against injustice in digital environments.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nPush back against injustice in digital environments.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nuse digital systems to collaborate with others.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nuse the proper etiquette to communicate in digital environments.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\nmanage and delete my digital footprint.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\npresent myself the way I want in digital environments.\nCommunication and collaboration (cSE)\n\n\ncreate digital content.\nDigital content creation (dSE)\n\n\nchange digital content in a way that new content is created.\nDigital content creation (dSE)\n\n\nidentify legal aspects in digital environments, such as terms of use and licenses.\nDigital content creation (dSE)\n\n\nwrite a simple command in a programming language.\nDigital content creation (dSE)\n\n\nprotect my digital devices from unwanted access.\nSafety (sSe)\n\n\nprotect my personal data in digital environments.\nSafety (sSe)\n\n\nrecognize health risks associated with using digital environments.\nSafety (sSe)\n\n\nuse digital environments to promote my health.\nSafety (sSe)\n\n\nrecognize the impact of digital environments on nature and the climate.\nSafety (sSe)\n\n\nidentify technical problems when using digital environments.\nProblem-solving (pSE)\n\n\nfind and apply various solutions to technical problems that arise.\nProblem-solving (pSE)\n\n\nfind the right digital system to meet non-technical challenges.\nProblem-solving (pSE)\n\n\ndevelop novel digital solutions.\nProblem-solving (pSE)\n\n\nidentify and improve the digital skills I lack.\nProblem-solving (pSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nResponses are obtained on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”."

    "section": "7.1 A comparison of operazionalization strategies",
    "text": "7.1 A comparison of operazionalization strategies\nAs can be read, these three ILSA studies have different theoretical approaches to Digital Self-efficacy. Because of their limitations, one of them will likely focus on some dimensions of the concept of self-efficacy and another on other elements. The following section is a comparative analysis of the orientations and definitions of each study in relation to the conceptual discussions of Self-efficacy.\nICILS presents a task orientation on self-efficacy concept in both cycles it presents. The questions ask if students can or cannot do concrete activities with technologies, leaving out self-regulatory elements of the concept. In the items there’s not query on levels of confidence or comfortability in the doing-task process. In that sense, ICILS focus on the magnitude of task achievement over strength. The concern is around the grades or levels of masterization on digital devices handling in isolation. This same approach explains why is the unique ILSA which divides a priori the Self-efficacy batteries in two: the first for a minus level of complexity in the masterization and the second for a more advance state of that process.\nBoth batteries of this study in 2013 and 2018 cycles are named as ‘ICT Self-efficacy’, which is consistent with the development of the debate on digital Self-efficacy (Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt, 2022). 2010’s were the epoche were Computer and Internet Self-efficacy were synthetized with ICT self-efficacy. It is noticeable that ICILS’ scales not only measure technical or informative tasks (as do the Computer self-efficacy approach), such as application development or file manipulation, but also others of evaluative nature and digital content creation. Likewise, it’s important to note that the scale is computer-device oriented, most of the tasks listed cannot be done in smartphones or other digital systems less powerful to process information.\nICILS’s statement again demonstrates its focus on digital literacy over a comprehensive understanding of digital competences. The question looks at “How well” the task is done, seeking to orient the concept to a sense of neatness or perfection of accomplishment, over levels of confidence in the process. Regarding the phrasing of the responses, ICILS has a battery consistent with the recommendations of the specialized literature on self-efficacy measurements (Bandura, 2006; Pajares & Schunk, 2002; Williams & Rhodes, 2016), in that it avoids can-do statements, and opts for a strategy that divides individuals who declare they know from those who declare they do not know but believe they could learn, as well as those who declare they are unable to do so. However, the relatively categorical nature with which the battery responses are composed tends to limit the analysis of individuals’ nuances and degrees of self-efficacy.\nPISA presents an inconsistent approach to measuring self-efficacy. In the 2018 version, both the statement and the items refer to the self-regulatory dimension of the concept, specifically with coping self-efficacy. The statement puts the individual in a context when asking for his or her own experience with digital devices. Then, some items ask explicitly for levels of comfort and others encourage the individuals to think about their own interpersonal relations (friends, family, etc.) before they judge their own level of self-efficacy. 2023 version makes a qualitative leap. The scale opts for a battery more similar to ICILS approach, where the statement assumes individual isolation, and the items identify concrete digitally mediated tasks to be solved.\nAlthough PISA does not add to its documentation a specific terminology to refer to digital self-efficacy, it is clear that in 2018 they presented a rather fuzzy concept approaching self-efficacy for the general use of digital devices, which does not specify specific tasks applicable in different systems. In that sense, it is difficult to encapsulate this proposal within the debate identified by Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt (2022). In the case of 2022, the items presented are in tune with the most recent Digital self-efficacy concept, as identify not only digital literacy aspects but digital creation, security and problem-solving too, independently of digital systems. If the analysis enters in details, even if the approach connect with actual standards and suggestions to measure the concept, in any case does not take into account the complexity of security and problem-solving dimensions, leaving only one minimal item for both competences.\nWith respect to the response wording, PISA proposals let researchers delve into numerical levels of self-efficacy, as they present more than three alternatives, with a clearly ordinal disposition. In both cycles, the responses determine grades of agreement in the achievement of the tasks deployed using the strategy suggested by Bandura (2006) and Williams & Rhodes (2016) of not dichotomizing between being able or not being able to do the task, but rather establishing levels of security to be able to achieve it.\nTIMMS declares explicitly the adoption of the ‘Digital Self-efficacy’ terminology, but this does not guarantee that it complies with the multidimensional and heterogeneous standards Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt (2022) suggests. The 2019 cycle have a very basic and minimalistic approach to digital efficacy expectancy. The tasks measured are excessively general and simple, as ‘use a touchscreen’ or ‘edit on a computer’. Although the items phrasing shows that the scale has a good balance between task and self-regulatory approach to self-efficacy, results to be are so abstract that they lose their specificity. The 2023 cycle presents major levels of complexity, but ignores tasks out of informational, evaluative, or creative skills with technologies, such as problem-solving or security. The battery is short and does not allow for a deeper dive into the concept of digital self-efficacy as discussed by Ulfert-Blank & Schmidt (2022).\nAs PISA, TIMMS in both cycles subscribe to a level of agreement on task achievement strategy. The measure let identify grades of Self-efficacy, but distinguishing whether individual can/cannot achievement or not.\nIn summary, it can be pointed out that ICILS emphasizes to a greater extent the ICT operational and technical aspects of the technologies, proposing two measures that linearly increase the degrees of complexity of the tasks, and excluding the attitudinal aspect in this process. While PISA details to a greater extent the mechanisms of self-regulation that accompany the concept of self-efficacy and Digital Competence, although it presents inconsistencies between its cycles. And finally, TIMMS has a minimalist strategy that does not give enough emphasis to digital self-efficacy to deepen the debates surrounding the concept."

    "text": "8.1 Digital divide framework\nIn this section, the ideas of Lythreatis et al. (2022) related to the concept of digital divide will be summarized. This is relevant to address since it provides us with a conceptual framework and bibliography to understand the digital inequalities, potentially addressed in this agenda. This chapter may potentially be expanded to include a more extensive historical overview of the concept, as well as the various approaches, criticisms, and proposals related to it.\nThe concept of the digital divide, coined by scholars during the 1990s, refers to the various gaps in access, usage, and outcomes associated with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The digital divide has gained increasing prominence due to the rise of the digital economy; the concept has been embraced by numerous organizations and public policy institutions. For instance, the United Nations places significant emphasis on ICT as a means to achieve its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and combat social inequalities. The significance of the concept lies not only in its impact on individuals’ relationships with the digital world but also in its implications for social mobility, given the pervasive integration of ICT into both the labor market and educational systems. Three levels or grades of the digital divide have been proposed, each with its specific characteristics and context.\nThe first level to emerge was the most restrictive, focusing solely on disparities in ICT access within the population. This was conceptualized simply as a dichotomy between those with effective access to technology and those without.\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, scholars recognized the need to broaden the concept, as access disparities alone failed to capture the growing inequalities tied to technology and digitalization. The second level of the digital divide encompasses differences in access to relevant content, the quality of connectivity, digital knowledge and skills, attitudes, behaviors, and emotions.\nA third level of the digital divide was proposed as a critique of the assumption that equal access and use of ICT would necessarily yield equal outcomes. Consequently, it became essential to examine the benefits or consequences derived from ICT usage.\nThe concept of the digital divide has been studied through various approaches and a wide range of variables. As a result, it has been proposed to conceptualize it as a multidimensional and dynamic phenomenon, aligned with the rapid pace of technological change in contemporary society.\nThe most relevant determinants of the digital divide include age, gender, socioeconomic status, attitudes, beliefs, emotions, ICT experience and training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events (e.g., COVID-19).\nMoreover, recent literature has proposed new levels of the digital divide. Bartikowski et al. (2018) argued that the type of internet use is a critical component of the digital divide. Cinamon (2020) highlighted data inequalities as a significant but insufficiently addressed aspect of the digital divide. Gran et al. (2021) introduced a new fourth level of the digital divide, which examines the positive and negative effects of algorithms on individuals. Awareness of and access to information about algorithms could become a crucial societal issue, particularly as algorithms assume a significant role in public participation, posing a challenge to democracy.\nIntegrating this research agenda into the broader literature on the digital divide is essential. Self-efficacy aligns with the second level of the digital divide but is also proposed as a significant predictor of digital skills, directly linked to the outcomes individuals can achieve through digital technologies(cite). Additionally, the Digital Self-Efficacy (DSE) research agenda aims to explore potential gender differences and their relationship with countries’ levels of development—a focus that aligns closely with studies on the digital divide. As a mechanism for personal reflection, self-efficacy has a strong connection with learning (and therefore with literacy and skills), particularly in today’s context of accelerated technological change, which encourages the constant acquisition of new skills. High self-efficacy enables individuals to adapt to the dynamic labor and educational environments and to independently learn the knowledge required by current circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nLythreatis, S., Singh, S.

    "text": "9.1 First Self-efficacy divide: access\nAccess is positioned as a crucial variable for Digital Self-Efficacy (DSE), as it represents the first element of the digital divide problematized in academic studies. Recent literature highlights a positive relationship between greater access to technology and higher levels of DSE. Stone (2020) identifies a significant relationship between increased access to ICT and greater self-efficacy in the domains of basic computing, internet use, applications, and content creation. Previous studies have also documented this relationship (Tondeur, Sinnaee, Van Houtte, & Van Braak, 2011, as cited in Hatlevik et al. (2018); Aesaert & Van Braak, 2014; Tsai & Tsai, 2010; Zhong, 2011, as cited in Senkbeil (2023)).\nDue to the simplicity of the dichotomy between access and lack of access to technology, multiple dimensions of access disparities to ICT have been proposed. A study by Ball et al. (2020) examines how these various dimensions relate to DSE, dividing it into Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE) and Application Self-Efficacy (ASE). Among the key findings, a significant relationship was observed between access to and use of computers at home and TSE; however, no such relationship was found with ASE."

    "text": "9.2 The socio-economic divide\nThe relationship between DSE and socioeconomic variables has also garnered academic interest, focusing on the connection between technological self-efficacies and factors such as cultural capital, parental education, and income. Hatlevik et al. (2018) found that ICT self-efficacy significantly increases with higher socioeconomic status in 11 countries. Similarly, Chen & Hu (2020), using PISA 2015 data, identified a significant relationship between socioeconomic level and ICT self-efficacy, although the effect was not very strong (varying across countries between 0.0241 and 0.1678). Additionally, (chikezieMeasuringImpactSocioeconomic2024?) reported that socioeconomic status is a significant predictor of technological self-efficacy. In contrast, Stone (2020) did not find a significant relationship between parental income (as reported by university students) and technology-related self-efficacy. Lastly, Bonanati & Buhl (2022) demonstrated a relationship between parental social capital and technological self-efficacy.\nIn summary, although there is a relationship between socioeconomic status and self-efficacy, this effect ranges from low to moderate and is not consistent across all countries. For this reason, it seems important to delve deeper into this relationship, considering various factors that determine household socioeconomic status. This is particularly relevant given that socioeconomic status consistently has the most significant effect on CIL across 14 countries (Hatlevik et al. (2018))."

    "section": "9.3 The gender divide",
    "text": "9.3 The gender divide\nGender has been a significant variable in studies on Digital Self-Efficacy (DSE). It is considered important due to the historical gender digital divide across all three levels and because DSE serves as an essential predictor of Computer and Information Literacy (CIL) (Hatlevik et al. (2018)). Moreover, DSE partially mediates gender differences in CIL and Computational Thinking (Campos & Scherer (2024)). Historically, a gender gap favoring males has been observed, with men displaying higher DSE and more positive attitudes toward technology (Whitley, 1997, as cited in Cai et al. (2017)). However, more recent studies highlight inconsistencies in the direction of this relationship (Cai et al. (2017)). For instance, one study finds that men demonstrate higher technological self-efficacy (Yau and Cheng, 2012, as cited in Cai et al. (2017); Fraillon, 2014), another reports no significant differences (Compton, Burkett, and Burkett, 2003, as cited in Cai et al. (2017)), and some even indicate a reversed relationship (Compton et al., 2003, as cited in Cai et al. (2017); Ray et al., 1999, as cited in Cai et al. (2017)). As a result, numerous studies continue to scrutinize the relationship between various types of technological self-efficacy (ICT self-efficacy, internet self-efficacy, DSE, etc.) and gender.\nA meta-analysis by (caiGenderAttitudesTechnology2017ahighlights?) that men exhibit better attitudes toward technology, including self-efficacy. Notably, the technological self-efficacy gap between men and women is the most reduced across years among those examined in the study. Additionally, Scherer & Siddiq (2015), using teacher questionnaire data from ICILS 2013, identify a relationship between being male and having higher computational self-efficacy. Contrary to these findings, a study by Hatlevik et al. (2018) using ICILS 2013 data reveals that women exhibit higher ICT self-efficacy, with effects ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 across nine sampled countries. Consistent with Hatlevik’s findings, Chen and Hu (2020), using PISA 2015 data, report a negative effect of being male on ICT self-efficacy, varying between -0.4369 and -0.1236 depending on the country.\nGiven the inconsistent results from studies on the relationship between gender and DSE, the construct has been segmented to better understand this complex relationship. As previously mentioned, two dimensions of DSE have been proposed: a basic dimension addressing tasks such as internet searches, communication, and social media use, and a specialized dimension involving more complex skills like programming or server management. Gebhardt et al. (2019) and Castillo et al. (2025) (a study conducted solely in Chile) argue, using ICILS 2018 data, that women have higher basic DSE, while men score higher on average in specialized DSE.\nDeparting from studies that rely on Large Assessment Study data (which, according to this review, are predominant), Stone (2020) developed a questionnaire comprising various batteries to measure different dimensions of technology-related self-efficacy. Administered to university applicants in the United States (n=260), the study found that women scored higher in the social media dimension (5.0 vs. 4.0, p&lt;0.01), while men scored higher in the basic computing dimension (3.79 vs. 3.48, p&lt;0.05)."

    "section": "9.4 Second divide variables",
    "text": "9.4 Second divide variables\nThe second level of the digital divide encompasses attitudes, skills, behaviors, and technology-related uses, which recent literature highlights as significant predictors of DSE. Multiple studies have explored the relationship between specific types of ICT use, attitudes toward ICT, ICT-related learning environments, and technological self-efficacy. For instance, a study by Chen & Hu (2020) confirms that interest is positively and significantly related to DSE. Additionally, it finds that ICT use for leisure and socialization are important mediators of this effect, whereas ICT use at school or for school-related tasks is not. This finding is supported by numerous studies; for example, Ball et al. (2020) demonstrates that using ICT to talk with friends or play video games significantly affects technological self-efficacy. Similarly, Hori & Fujii (2021) show that ICT use in schools does not impact self-efficacy, whereas ICT use at home for learning and leisure significantly does.\nThe above suggests that the development of high technological self-efficacy in an individual occurs primarily in the home environment, particularly influenced by the context of learning, use, and types of technology usage. Bonanati & Buhl (2022) explore the relationship between characteristics of the home learning environment and ICT self-efficacy. The authors reveal that children whose parents engage in more online activities with them tend to have higher self-efficacy and identify a relationship between parental attitudes and their children’s self-efficacy. In line with this, Hammer et al. (2021) demonstrate that parental values and beliefs are related to children’s digital self-efficacy; however, this relationship is mediated only by the age at which children are given smartphones. Relatedly, Lai et al. (2022) argue that greater smartphone use is positively associated with DSE, though problematic uses and cases where the relationship is reversed also exist.\nHatlevik et al. (2018) finds that autonomous learning is positively related to ICT self-efficacy, making it the most consistently observed relationship across countries. Eastin and LaRose (2006) discover that outcome expectations are also linked to DSE, as is internet use experience, which is identified as the best predictor in their study."
