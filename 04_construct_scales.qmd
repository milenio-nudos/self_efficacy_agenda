## Critiques of Bandura and others' proposals

In 1984, Cognitive Therapy and Research dedicated a special issue to Bandura's thesis on self-efficacy. Some relevant scholars commented on Bandura's theory's limitations and confusing issues.

An article by @eastmanTheoreticalMethodologicalDifficulties1984 on that issue said that Bandura's definition of self-efficacy is fundamentally ambiguous regarding the distinction between self-efficacy expectations and outcome expectations. Separating acts (tasks) from outcomes, particularly in complex activities, is difficult in real-life experiences. Many behaviors involve a continuous interplay between actions and their outcomes, making it challenging to assess self-efficacy independently of outcome considerations. The authors express skepticism about the applicability of Bandura's findings to everyday life, arguing that most psychological issues involve tasks and outcomes that are not clearly defined. They believe this complexity makes it difficult for individuals to assess their self-efficacy accurately.

This condition is traduced in empirical problems. The empirical studies conducted by Bandura often assess self-efficacy through tasks that are discrete and limited in scope, which may not adequately capture the broader complexities of real-life situations where multiple outcomes exist. The assessments of self-efficacy in Bandura's studies do not account for the variability and unpredictability of outcomes that individuals might consider, thus failing to demonstrate that efficacy judgments can be made independently of outcome considerations [@marzillierContinuingProblemsSelfefficacy1984]. [^04_construct_scales-1]

[^04_construct_scales-1]: I add this to the agenda review because I think could be useful for General and Specialized Digital Self-efficacy distinction. If one follow the argument, in General tasks there are more possibilities to discriminate between efficacy expectatives and outcome than on Specialized tasks.

Recent contributions have indicated that the self-efficacy definition's grey area with outcome expectations also affects its relation with motivational mechanisms of action. If individuals do not analytically distinguish, with utmost clarity, efficacy expectations from expected outcomes in action, it is likely that the degree of agency is mostly explained by the motivations that generate the outcomes rather than by perceived singular capabilities. In that sense, Self-efficacy would be an epiphenomenon of motivation rather than a determinant. However, if self-efficacy and motivation are intermingled, there would be confusion in distinguishing the agency's self-reactiveness and self-reflectiveness moments that Bandura previously suggested [@williamsConfoundedSelfEfficacyConstruct2016].

As a result, Researchers on Self-efficacy indicate that the operationalization of the concept needs to avoid assessments that confound the judgments of efficacy and motivation of the action. To rate the confidence in a target behavior, some assessments ask participants whether they *would do* the action or *how confident* they are to achieve it. This would be a better strategy than *'can-do'* scale construction strategies. @kirschSelfefficacyOutcomeExpectancies1995 explains there are two colloquial uses of the phrase can do. One meaning reflects perceived capability per se based on one's estimation of their actual capability to perform a task (i.e. the original definition of efficacy expectancy as distinct from outcome expectancy). The second meaning reflects motivation based on---in his examples---anticipated "disgust, embarrassment, guilt, or shame". The second would be a motivation measurement, not a self-efficacy one. The risk is to interpret *"I can do \[target behaviour\]"* as *"I will do \[target behavior\]"*.

The *can/can't do* scale approach would be useful if Self-efficacy is measured as *task self-efficacy*, this is, focusing on the isolated task, with no context o background. But we know in complex activities this becomes difficult, so it's better to opt for other strategies such as *can-do-motivation one ("I could do it if I would like to do it")*.
