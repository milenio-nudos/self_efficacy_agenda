  abstract = {Most studies on the assessment of ICT competences use measures of ICT self-efficacy. These studies are often accused that they suffer from self-reported bias, i.e. students can over- and/or underestimate their ICT competences. As such, taking bias and accuracy of ICT self-efficacy into account, would improve the validity of these studies and the predictive power of the ICT self-efficacy measures used. Consequently, the general aim of this study is twofold. First, to explore the degree to which primary school students are under- and/or overestimating their ability in digital information processing and communication. Second, to identify student characteristics that are possibly related to the accuracy of ICT self-efficacy. Information on accuracy and bias of ICT self-efficacy was gathered by comparing students' results on an ICT self-efficacy scale and a performance based ICT competence test. Both instruments were administered to 378 sixth grade students from 58 primary schools in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium). Information on the explanatory student characteristics was gathered through a questionnaire that was administered to the same students. The results indicate that primary school students make relatively accurate and positively biased judgments about their ability in digital information processing and communication. Further, the results indicate that primary school students' actual ICT competences and previous ICT experience are related to their accuracy of ICT self-efficacy. As this study is one of the first to investigate primary school students' accuracy and bias of ICT self-efficacy and to identify potential explanatory variables, it provides new insights into the nature of ICT self-efficacy.},

Information on pupils' ICT self-efficacy and the pupil level factors was gathered through a questionnaire administered to 2421 sixth grade pupils (and their parents) in 92 Flemish primary schools. A questionnaire was also administered to the teachers (n=141) and the schools' ICT coordinators (n=86) in order to gather information on classroom and school level factors. The results of the multilevel analysis indicate that ICT self-efficacy can be considered as a pupil, rather than a class or school, phenomenon. The results indicate that the pupil level factors ICT experience, ICT attitude, parental ICT attitude, controlling learning style, analytic intelligence and amotivation, are related to primary school pupils' ICT self-efficacy.},

Perceived self-efficacy helps to account for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pursuits.

Human agency is characterized by a number of core features that operate through phenomenal and functional consciousness. These include the temporal extension of agency through intentionality and forethought, self-regulation by self-reactive influence, and self-reflectiveness about one's capabilities, quality of functioning, and the meaning and purpose of one's life pursuits. Personal agency operates within a broad network of sociostructural influences. In these agentic transactions, people are producers as well as products of social systems. Social cognitive theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: direct personal agency, proxy agency that relies on others to act on one's behest to secure desired outcomes, and collective agency exercised through socially coordinative and interdependent effort. Growing transnational embeddedness and interdependence are placing a premium on collective efficacy to exercise control over personal destinies and national life.},

Data collected from 137 university students were tested against the research model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results suggest that there are significant gender differences in perceptions of general CSE, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention to use but no significant differences in specific CSE, perceived usefulness. Additionally, the findings reveal that specific CSE is more salient than general CSE in influencing perceived ease of use, while general CSE seems to be the salient factor on perceived usefulness for both female and male combined. Moreover, general CSE was salient to determine the behavioral intention to use indirectly for female despite lower perception of general CSE than male's, and specific CSE exhibited stronger indirect effect on behavioral intention to use than general CSE for female despite similar perception of specific CSE as males'. These findings provide important implications for mobile learning adoption and usage.},

A survey of Canadian managers and professionals was conducted to develop and validate a measure of computer self-efficacy and to assess both its impacts and antecedents. Computer self-efficacy was found to exert a significant influence on individuals' expectations of the outcomes of using computers, their emotional reactions to computers (affect and anxiety), as well as their actual computer use. An individual's self-efficacy and outcome expectations were found to be positively influenced by the encouragement of others in their work group, as well as others' use of computers. Thus, self-efficacy represents an important individual trait, which moderates organizational influences (such as encouragement and support) on an individual's decision to use computers. Understanding self-efficacy, then, is important to the successful implementation of systems in organizations. The existence of a reliable and valid measure of self-efficacy makes assessment possible and should have implications for organizational support, training, and implementation.}

Survey data were collected to develop a reliable operational measure of Internet self-efficacy and to examine its construct validity. An eight-item Internet self-efficacy scale developed for the present study was found to be reliable and internally consistent. Prior Internet experience, outcome expectancies and Internet use were significantly and positively correlated to Internet self-efficacy judgments. Internet stress and self-disparagement were negatively related to Internet self-efficacy.

In this paper we examine the conceptual basis of self-efficacy theory. In particular, the distinction between outcome and efficacy expectations is analyzed in relation to fear and avoidant behavior. We conclude that self-efficacy theory is conceptually problematic and, in particular, that the central concept of efficacy expectations is not unambiguously differentiated from outcome expectations, despite Bandura's (1978) claim to the contrary. Similarly, we suggest that what is actually being assessed in the empirical studies is unclear. We conclude that the empirical findings are less impressive when the circumscribed nature of the behavioral tasks is recognized. Finally, we suggest that resolutions of both the conceptual and methodological difficulties are necessary before Bandura's (1978) claim, that self-efficacy is a unifying construct, can be properly evaluated.},

In his seminal 1977 publication, Bandura emphasized that these representations -- visualized actions and outcomes stemming from reflective thought -- form the basis from which individuals assess their personal efficacy. An efficacy belief, he contended, is the ``conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes'' one desires (p. 193). Efficacy beliefs serve as the primary means by which people are able to exercise a measure of control over their lives. During the next two decades, Bandura (1986, 1997) advanced his social cognitive theory, in which people are viewed as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting, and self-regulating rather than as solely reactive organisms, products of environmental or concealed inner influences. From this agentic perspective, people are seen as contributors to their life circumstances, not just recipients of them. In this way, people are ``partial architects of their own destinies'' (Bandura, 1997, p. 8).},

The research presented here evaluated the validity (construct, convergent, predictive), reliability (internal consistency, test-retest), and measurement invariance (across gender and time) of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE). A total of 3667 undergraduate students from Serbia participated in three studies. Cross-sectional data were used in Study 1 and Study 2, and longitudinal data were used in Study 3. The results supported the GSE's modified single-factor structure as well as strict measurement invariance across gender and time. The GSE demonstrated adequate internal consistency, moderate 4-month and 2-year test-retest reliability, and good convergent validity in relation to measures of positive expectations and subjective well-being. After controlling for the initial levels of well-being, the GSE showed limited predictive utility in predicting subjective well-being (positive affect, life satisfaction, emotional distress) over periods of 4~months and 2~years. Our findings suggest that use of the GSE for predictive purposes should be carefully examined in future studies.},

  abstract = {Many studies have been carried out on this concept of self efficacy in the academic settings. For example, Schunk (1995) stated that students when engaged in activities are affected by personal (e.g., goal setting, information processing) and situational influences (rewards, feedbacks). These provide students an idea on how well they learn. Self efficacy was enhanced when students perceived they performed well. On the other hand, Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara and Pastorelli (1996), reported that parents' academic aspirations for their children, influence the children's academic achievement directly or indirectly by influencing their self efficacy. Based on the theoretical explanation on self efficacy and findings of past studies, it is therefore the aim of this study to find out the relationship between students' self efficacy and their English language achievement. In Malaysia, English is a second language but since 2003, English is the medium of instruction for mathematics and science subjects for year one, form one and form six students. Based on this scenario, it is therefore pertinent to find out whether performance in the English language is largely determined by their perceived English language efficacy. A descriptive-correlational study was conducted on 1,146 students from eight secondary schools in the Petaling district, Selangor. The instruments used to measure self efficacy were the Self Efficacy Scale developed by Bandura (1995) and the Self Efficacy Scale developed by Kim and Park (1997). The findings showed that 51 percent of students had high self efficacy while 48 percent showed low self efficacy. Correlational analysis showed positive correlations between several dimensions of self efficacy that is, academic achievement eficacy (r = 0.48, p = 0.001); other expectancy beliefs (r = 0.34, p = 0.005); and self assertiveness (r = 0.41, p = 0.005) with academic performance in English language. In conclusion, achievement in English language will improve when students have high self efficacy in the language. The implications are discussed in relation to teaching and learning within the school settings. Abstrak: Beberapa kajian telah dijalankan dalam bidang akademik tentang konsep efikasi kendiri. Contohnya, Schunk (1995) menyatakan bahawa pelajar yang terlibat dalam aktiviti sering dipengaruhi oleh faktor peribadi (penentuan matlamat, pemprosesan maklumat) dan situasi (ganjaran, maklum balas). Perkara ini memberi idea kepada pelajar tentang sebaik mana mereka telah belajar. Efikasi kendiri akan meningkat apabila pelajar beranggapan mereka telah melakukan yang terbaik. Sebaliknya, Bandura, Babaranelli, Caprara dan Pastorelli (1996) melaporkan bahawa aspirasi akademik ibu bapa untuk anak-anak mempengaruhi secara langsung atau tidak langsung pencapaian akademik mereka melalui pengaruh ibu bapa ke atas efikasi kendiri anak-anak. Berdasarkan penerangan teori tentang efikasi kendiri dan dapatan kajian lepas, maka tujuan kajian ini adalah untuk melihat perhubungan antara efikasi kendiri pelajar dengan pencapaian 61 Rahil Mahyuddin et al. mereka dalam bahasa Inggeris. Di Malaysia, bahasa Inggeris merupakan bahasa kedua tetapi sejak 2003, bahasa Inggeris ialah bahasa pengantar bagi mata pelajaran matematik dan sains untuk murid tahun satu, tingkatan satu dan tingkatan enam rendah. Senario ini membuatkan kajian ini relevan untuk melihat sama ada prestasi dalam bahasa Inggeris ditentukan oleh persepsi pelajar tentang efikasi mereka dalam bahasa Inggeris. Reka bentuk kajian ini ialah deskriptif korelasi dan dijalankan ke atas 1,146 pelajar daripada lapan buah sekolah menengah di daerah Petaling, Selangor. Instrumen yang digunakan untuk mengukur efikasi kendiri ialah Skala Efikasi Kendiri oleh Bandura (1995), dan Kim dan Park (1997). Dapatan menunjukkan 51 peratus pelajar mempunyai efikasi kendiri yang tinggi manakala 48 peratus mempuyai efikasi kendiri yang rendah. Analisis korelasi menunjukkan perhubungan positif antara beberapa dimensi efikasi kendiri, iaitu efikasi pencapaian akdemik (r = 0.48, p = 0.001); kepercayaan jangkaan yang lain (r = 0.34, p = 0.005) dan ketegasan kendiri (r = 0.41, p = 0.005) dengan prestasi dalam bahasa Inggeris. Kesimpulannya, pencapaian dalam bahasa Inggeris akan meningkat sekiranya pelajar mempunyai efikasi kendiri yang tinggi dalam bahasa tersebut. Implikasinya dibincangkan dari segi pengajaran dan pembelajaran dalam bilik darjah.}

Our purpose is to ascertain their relative abilities to isolate the CSE construct from other related constructs and to capture variance in performance attributed to changes in CSE level. In addition, we investigate the importance of ensuring the measure being used is sufficiently aligned with the task domain of interest. Finally, we explore the stability of CSE measures as they relate to the current state of evolution within the computing domain. Marakas, Yi, and Johnson ( 1998) proposed a framework for the construction of instruments intended to measure the CSE construct that we have adopted as a basis for this series of investigations. To that end, we advance and test a set of hypotheses derived from the Marakas et al. ( 1998) framework. Results of the analyses support the need for adherence to the tenets of the proposed framework as well as provide evidence that CSE measures suffer from degradation of their explanatory power over time. Further, this study brings forth the importance of appropriately validating measures of CSE using approaches intended for a formative rather than a reflective construct. These results suggest that the common practices of instrument validation and reuse of long-standing instruments to measure CSE may not be the most effective approach to the study of the construct. Implications for future research are discussed.}

We suggest that such results may be attributable to a general lack of attention to the dynamic, multileveled, and multifaceted nature of the computer self-efficacy construct. We offer examples from the extant CSE literature suggesting weaknesses in existing measures of the construct as well as issues associated with manipulations and the need for control of antecedent and consequent factors directly associated with CSE. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to provide a thorough review of the extant literature related to CSE; (2) to present an integrated model of empirical findings, constructed from a wide variety of disciplines, that comprehensively defines the multifaceted nature of task-specific CSE in terms of its antecedent, consequent, and moderating factors; (3) to present a conceptual model of CSE at the general versus task-specific level; and (4) to use the two models of CSE to proffer guidelines for both measurement and manipulation of the construct. Through our review of the CSE literature, we offer several thoughts regarding the nature of the empirical results obtained to date. The combined objectives serve as a basis for establishing a foundation upon which future research investigating the CSE construct can be based.},

This chapter discusses that the belief that children create, develop, and hold to be true about themselves are vital forces in their success or failure in all endeavors, and of particular relevance to educators for their success or failure in school. The assumption that children's self-beliefs are inextricably tied to their thinking and functioning, seems so sound, so obvious, and so commonsensical. One might well think that research on academic motivation and achievement should naturally focus, at least in great part, on the things that children come to believe about themselves. The chapter's focus on a child's sense of ``self'' seems so reasonable that one would think it has always been instrumental in framing the discussion around educational concerns. The chapter explains the historical view that explains that understanding critical issues related to children's sense of self is crucial to understanding the manner in which they deal with all of life's tasks and challenges. Researchers generally agree that children develop a self-concept primarily through their interpretations of the reflected appraisals of others. The chapter concludes by reviewing psychological concepts that are responsible for the current resurgence of interest in self-beliefs in recent years, and by providing a discussion of some of the major educational implications that result from this renewed focus on students' self-beliefs in school.}

The research used self-efficacy theory to build a model that predicts relationships between antecedents to employees' remote work self-efficacy assessments and their behavioral and attitudinal consequences. The model was tested using responses from 376 remotely-managed employees in 18 diverse organizations. Overall, the results indicated that remote employees' self-efficacy assessments play a critical role in influencing their remote work effectiveness, perceived productivity, job satisfaction and ability to cope. Furthermore, strong relationships were observed between employees' remote work self-efficacy judgments and several antecedents, including remote work experience and training, best practices modeling by management, computer anxiety, and IT capabilities. Because many of these antecedents can be controlled managerially, these findings suggest important ways in which a remote employee's work performance can be enhanced, through the intermediary effect of improved remote work self-efficacy. The current study also provides a basis for future research in the remote work area through its development and testing of a remote management framework.}

Much of the work on the social psychology of intergroup relations has focused on patterns of individual prejudices and discrimination and on the motivational sequences of interpersonal interaction. The intensity of explicit intergroup conflicts of interests is closely related in human cultures to the degree of opprobrium attached to the notion of "renegade" or "traitor." The basic and highly reliable finding is that the trivial, ad hoc intergroup categorization leads to in-group favoritism and discrimination against the out-group. Many orthodox definitions of "social groups" are unduly restrictive when applied to the context of intergroup relations. The equation of social competition and intergroup conflict rests on the assumptions concerning an "ideal type" of social stratification in which the salient dimensions of intergroup differentiation are those involving scarce resources.},

With increasing system capabilities, agency between the user and the system shifts, with high autonomy DSS being able to take over complete information processing tasks. In the present study, we distinguish degrees of DSS autonomy, operationalized by levels of automation (LOA), the delegation of task processing stages, and user control. In two vignette studies, we investigate the effects of DSS autonomy on perceptions of information load reduction, technostress, and user intention as well as the moderating role of technology and job experience. With high DSS autonomy, participants reported higher levels of information load reduction and technostress as well as lower levels of user intention. Job experience was a significant moderator. For high autonomy DSS, participants in the high job experience condition indicated greater information load reducation, lower technostress, and higher user intentions. Results suggest, that while being beneficial for decreasing information load, high DSS autonomy may negatively impact technostress and user intentions. It is suggested that technology and job training may improve user reactions.},

  abstract = {Today, digitalization is affecting all areas of life, such as education or work. The competent use of digital systems (esp. information and communication technologies [ICT]) has thus become an essential skill. Despite longstanding research on human-technology interaction and diverse theoretical approaches describing competences for interacting with digital systems, research still offers mixed results regarding the structure of digital competences. Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. The present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (DSE) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. Further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the DigComp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. The factorial structure of the DSE scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. Further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ICT use, technophobia). Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: On the basis of previous research, it was expected that perceived self-efficacy and social comparison would contribute to pursued goals and that these goals would influence course grades. It was further expected that a task orientation would contribute to perceived self-efficacy, and that an ego orientation would contribute to social comparison. Aims: The central question in the present study is whether the relationships between the above-mentioned motivational variables are as strongly developed in a particular area amongst beginners as they are amongst more advanced students. In view of the fact that beginners' knowledge concerning task requirements is restricted, we predicted that whilst relationships between these variables would be weak or absent in the case of beginners, they would be relatively strong amongst more advanced students. Samples: The sample consisted of 150 students from a secondary school. Methods: The participants answered questions about goal orientations, appraisals of self-efficacy, social comparison and about their personal goals. Course grades were used as a measure of study results. Results and conclusion: It was found that amongst the beginners and the advanced students perceived self-efficacy contributed to pursued goals and these goals in turn contributed to course grades. The relations between these variables were clearly less strong for the beginners than for the advanced students. Furthermore, it was ascertained that a task orientation contributed only to perceived self-efficacy amongst the advanced students, suggesting that for these students motivational variables were operative whereas they were still undeveloped amongst the beginners.},

  abstract = {The Information System (IS) Success model implies that IS users possess baseline technical abilities; an assumption that, if not met, may adversely affect the constructs and relationships proposed by the model. We propose that the level of users' technical proficiency should be accounted for when considering deployment of information systems. However, considering the extant literature, it is unclear precisely what constitutes technical proficiency in today's business environment. Using a Delphi method approach, we develop the technical proficiency construct to uncover what competencies indicate technically proficiency, what business needs such proficiencies address, and how technical proficiency can be assessed. We uncover 16 qualities of technical proficiency, 14 common technology business needs, and 13 methods to assess proficiency. This research lays the groundwork for future research regarding IS Success and technical proficiency. Practitioners can use these findings to help better prepare their workforce for IS deployment.},

  abstract = {Self-efficacy is central to health behaviour theories due to its robust predictive capabilities. In this paper we present and review evidence for a self-efficacy-as-motivation argument in which standard self-efficacy questionnaires---i.e., ratings of whether participants ``can do'' the target behaviour---reflect motivation rather than perceived capability. The potential implication is that associations between self-efficacy ratings (particularly those that employ a ``can do'' operationalization) and health-related behaviours simply indicate that people are likely to do what they are motivated to do. There is some empirical evidence for the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument, with three studies demonstrating causal effects of outcome expectancy on subsequent self-efficacy ratings. Three additional studies show that---consistent with the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument---controlling for motivation by adding the phrase ``if you wanted to'' to the end of self-efficacy items decreases associations between self-efficacy ratings and motivation. Likewise, a qualitative study using a thought-listing procedure demonstrates that self-efficacy ratings have motivational antecedents. The available evidence suggests that the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument is viable, although more research is needed. Meanwhile, we recommend that researchers look beyond self-efficacy to identify the many and diverse sources of motivation for health-related behaviours.},

The effectiveness of current specialized English translation instruction (SETI) in mainland China, however, is unclear because university students have become less interested in, and less confident when doing, English translation. This study investigated the effects of online cooperative translation on EFL students' levels of interest and self-efficacy with respect to specialized English translation through a questionnaire, focus group interview, interaction data analysis, and pre-test and post-test on 48 second-year college students in China majoring in educational technology. The results showed that online cooperative translations could significantly increase student interest and self-efficacy in specialized English translation. In cooperative translation, student engagement was significantly and linearly correlated with their interest and self-efficacy in translation. We conclude with recommendations on reforming current SETI practices in mainland China's universities.},
