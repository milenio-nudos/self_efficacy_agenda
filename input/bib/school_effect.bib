  abstract = {Bei der Vermittlung eines kompetenten Umgangs mit Medien und Technologien tragen Lehrkr{\"a}fte eine grosse Verantwortung. Jedoch bietet die wachsende Verf{\"u}gbarkeit unterschiedlicher Technologien Jugendlichen die M{\"o}glichkeit, F{\"a}higkeiten im Umgang mit Informations- und Computertechnologien (ICT) auch ausserhalb der Schule zu erlernen. Folglich ist die Schule nicht alleine verantwortlich f{\"u}r die Vermittlung von Computer- und Informationskompetenzen (CIL). Dennoch zeigen Forschungsergebnisse, dass Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler in einigen L{\"a}ndern angeben, dass sie ihre F{\"a}higkeiten im digitalen Bereich haupts{\"a}chlich von ihren Lehrkr{\"a}ften vermittelt bekommen haben. Unbekannt ist jedoch, welche Faktoren (z.B. Eigenschaften der Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler, der Schulen und Bedingungen in den einzelnen L{\"a}ndern) daf{\"u}r verantwortlich sind, dass die Lernenden sich verst{\"a}rkt auf die Lehrkr{\"a}fte verlassen. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es, diese Faktoren systematisch zu untersuchen. Ausgehend von vorhandenen Studien wird ein Model entwickelt und mittels Mehrebenenanalyse anhand von Daten aus 14 L{\"a}ndern (alle Teilnehmer der letzten International Computer and Information Literacy Study) getestet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen den signifikanten Einfluss der sozio{\"o}konomischen Rahmenbedingungen, der Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung und des Geschlechts der Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}ler sowie des ICT Development Index. Eigenschaften der Schulen hingegen beeinflussen die Vermittlung der Kompetenzen nicht signifikant. Abschlie{\ss}end werden die vorliegenden Ergebnisse im Hinblick auf das Zusammenwirken von Lehrkr{\"a}ften sowie Sch{\"u}lerinnen und Sch{\"u}lern bei der schulischen Medienerziehung diskutiert.},

\\
RQ: "To what extent is the incidence of learning CIL from teachers influenced by student, school, and country characteristics?"\\
\\
Based on Vekiri's work, he first hypothesis he use is central for our study: H1. Female  students  report  a  higher  incidence  of  learning  CIL  from  teachers  than  male student. H3. Students  with  higher  ICT  self-efficacy  report  a  lower  incidence  of  learning  CIL  from teachers than students with lower ICT self-efficacy.\\
\\
Author ocuppies and ICT development index we could use too.\\
\\
Results show:\\
- 10\% of variance of learning ict from teachers is associated with differences between schools, 12\% between countries and 78\% for individual students.\\
- Confirm H1: Controlling by SES, women indicates more learning of CIL from teachers than male.\\
- Confirm H3: Students with more advance self-efficacy have negative incidence in learning ict from teachers.\\
- Interesting: ICT development index have negative significative effect on learning ict from teachers.}

A sample of 593 Norwegian students from 43 upper secondary schools participated in a survey with a digital competence quiz and a self-report questionnaire. Analysis showed differences in students' digital competence and indication of digital diversity on both student and school level. A multilevel analysis reveals that cultural capital, language integration at home, self-efficacy, strategic use of information and average grades of the students predict 20\% of the variation in students' digital competence score and 49\% of the variation between schools' average digital competence score.},

  abstract = {Skills enabling and ensuring universal access to information have been investigated intensively during the past few years. The research results provide knowledge on the differences and digital divides. When examining ICT skill levels, the accuracy of assessment is one of the key issues to address the results and gain the applicable data for appropriate interventions to enhance digital inclusion. To date, ICT skill assessment is based mainly on self-reports and subjective evaluations. However, as previous studies have shown, people tend to overrate or underrate their own levels of competence. Thus, novel performance-based approach for assessing ICT skills is presented in this paper. The ICT skill test contains 42 tasks grouped into 17 ICT fields. The study was conducted with upper comprehensive and upper secondary level school students (n~=~3159) and their teachers (n~=~626) during years 2014--2016 in Finland. Using factor analysis, three ICT skills factors were created: basic digital skills, advanced technical skills, and professional ICT skills. The performance in the ICT skill test was also divided by gender, as the male students and teachers outperformed the female students and teacher. Outperformance also occurred by educational level, as both upper secondary level students and teachers were seen as possessing higher-level ICT skills than students and teachers at the comprehensive level. We thus argue that to compare the ICT skills and the validity of the assessments, we needed to ensure consistent assessment for both students and teachers. In addition, in order to diminish the ICT skill gap among students, interventions using formal education are urgently needed, and in particular, more attention should be given to both teacher training and in-service training.},

  abstract = {In most western countries, the participation of females in ICT professional careers is not only low but is also still falling [Anderson, N., Lankhear, C., Timms, C., \& Courtney, L. (in press). Because it's boring, irrelevant and I don't like computers': Why high school girls avoid professionally-oriented ICT subjects. Computers \& Education.]. Policy makers as well as researchers often assume that the interest of girls in computing and ICT-professions could be increased at school. For example, female teachers who are confident ICT-users, are expected to act as positive role models for girls. However, because most of the research on gender and computing has been focussing on the influence of none-school related factors, there is little empirical evidence that schools or teachers are able to influence girls' attitude toward ICT. Using the data of a Dutch large-scale survey on ICT use in primary education (almost 4000 grade 5 students), this study explores the influence of both none-school related factors and school related factors on students' computer attitude. Although the between-school variance of girls' computer attitude is higher than that of boys' computer attitude, multilevel analyses show that most of the variance in computer attitude is explained by none-school related student factors. Two school related factors turned out to have a small positive effect on the computer attitude of girls: a teacher-centred pedagogical approach and the computer experience of female teachers.},

- female have less positive attitudes tahn male, but no negative one.\\
- Although boys experience more encouragement from their parents than girls do (Table 3), the effect of encouragement by parents seems even a little stronger for girls' computer attitude (.35) than boys' computer attitude (.34) \\
- More boys than girls have gender stereotyped views of computers. The majority of boys in grade 5 are convinced that boys know more about computers than girls do; about a third of the girls agrees with them. Girls with less gender-stereotyped views on computers were expected to have more positive computer attitudes. --{$>$} Really important!\\
- ecause girls show lower intensity and lower self-efficacy in computer use than boys, these reciprocal relations may increase gender differences in computer attitudes in the long term. In other words, gender differences in computer attitude may increase with age.\\
- However, if the teacher is female, the computer experience of the teacher has a small effect on girls' computer attitude (.07, Table 4). This significant interaction effect accords with the `role model theory'. This theory assumes that female teachers who are confident in using ICT can enhance the attractiveness of computers for girls (e.g. Brosnan, 1998). \\
- In other words, although female teachers show the same intensity and the same variety in ICT use for educational purposes, they are less convinced about their ICT knowledge and skills than their male colleagues are.\\
\\
"This means that teacher trainers should not only make their students aware of gender differences in computer attitudes and computer use of primary school children, but also pay attention to gender differences in self-confidence in ICT use of future teachers." --{$>$} Look at teachers inequality}

It has three objectives: (1) Describe the development and characteristics of the assessments; (2) Present a synthesis of the facets of ICT literacy measured; and (3) Investigate to what extent information about reliability and validity is provided. A total of 38 tests reported in 66 studies were included. The results indicate that most of the tests target lower secondary students, comprise multiple-choice item designs, and are evaluated by quantitative methodology. The majority of the tests measure facets such as searching, retrieving, and evaluating digital information, and technical skills. In particular, the access to tests measuring digital communication, collaboration, safety, and problem solving is limited. This review demonstrates that an adequate norm for documenting and reporting test quality is lacking. Our findings point to potential future directions in developing and reporting assessments of ICT literacy.},
