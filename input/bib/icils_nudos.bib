  abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to examine the interaction effects of gender and motivational beliefs on students' self-regulated learning. Specifically, three types of motivational beliefs under the Expectancy-Value Model were examined, namely self-efficacy, control beliefs and anxiety. Methodology: A quantitative correlational research design was used to achieve the research objectives. Data were collected through the questionnaire survey method from 322 secondary school students (166 males; 156 females). The samples were taken from two ICT-integrated schools located in Peninsular Malaysia. The learning environment in these schools was conducive for self-regulated learning. The Learning Strategies Scale and the Motivation Scale, taken from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) were used to measure the variables of the study. Findings: The findings showed that self-efficacy and control beliefs were positively related to students' self-regulated learning. Anxiety, however, was found to be negatively related to self-regulated learning. The interactions between gender and levels of motivational beliefs on self-regulated learning were also explored in this study. The relationships between self-efficacy and self-regulated learning differed according to gender. However, there were no significant interaction effects between gender and internal control beliefs on self-regulated learning. This implies that gender differences in self-regulated learning were not due to the differences in control beliefs and anxiety. Significance: This study offers insights on the interaction effects between motivational beliefs, and gender and self-regulated learning. It may help to develop effective instructional strategies to enhance students' self-regulated learning skill in ICT-related learning environments.},

  abstract = {Most studies on the assessment of ICT competences use measures of ICT self-efficacy. These studies are often accused that they suffer from self-reported bias, i.e. students can over- and/or underestimate their ICT competences. As such, taking bias and accuracy of ICT self-efficacy into account, would improve the validity of these studies and the predictive power of the ICT self-efficacy measures used. Consequently, the general aim of this study is twofold. First, to explore the degree to which primary school students are under- and/or overestimating their ability in digital information processing and communication. Second, to identify student characteristics that are possibly related to the accuracy of ICT self-efficacy. Information on accuracy and bias of ICT self-efficacy was gathered by comparing students' results on an ICT self-efficacy scale and a performance based ICT competence test. Both instruments were administered to 378 sixth grade students from 58 primary schools in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium). Information on the explanatory student characteristics was gathered through a questionnaire that was administered to the same students. The results indicate that primary school students make relatively accurate and positively biased judgments about their ability in digital information processing and communication. Further, the results indicate that primary school students' actual ICT competences and previous ICT experience are related to their accuracy of ICT self-efficacy. As this study is one of the first to investigate primary school students' accuracy and bias of ICT self-efficacy and to identify potential explanatory variables, it provides new insights into the nature of ICT self-efficacy.},

Information on pupils' ICT self-efficacy and the pupil level factors was gathered through a questionnaire administered to 2421 sixth grade pupils (and their parents) in 92 Flemish primary schools. A questionnaire was also administered to the teachers (n=141) and the schools' ICT coordinators (n=86) in order to gather information on classroom and school level factors. The results of the multilevel analysis indicate that ICT self-efficacy can be considered as a pupil, rather than a class or school, phenomenon. The results indicate that the pupil level factors ICT experience, ICT attitude, parental ICT attitude, controlling learning style, analytic intelligence and amotivation, are related to primary school pupils' ICT self-efficacy.},

In this research field, two problems seem to occur. First, research findings are inconclusive. Second, most studies are conducted from the perspective of self-perceived ICT competence. Such measures suffer from self-reported bias, as they depend on students' own judgment of their ICT competences. This study aims to tackle both these problems. First, the outline of the design of a computer and performance-based assessment test that measures primary school students' ICT competences in a direct and valid way is presented. Second, the relationship between gender and socioeconomic status, and the students' results on the test i.e. their actual ICT competences was investigated. The performance-based test was administered to a representative sample of 378 sixth-grade students of 58 primary schools. The results of this study indicate that primary school students in general have particular difficulties in higher-order ICT competences that focus on communicating in a socially acceptable and clearly understandable way. Moreover, results show that girls have better technical ICT skills and higher-order ICT competences than boys. With regard to socioeconomic status, results show that the educational level of the mother is positively related to both students' technical ICT skills and higher-order ICT competences.},

En el pasado, varios estudios han investigado la relaci{\'o}n entre el g{\'e}nero y el nivel socioecon{\'o}mico por un lado, y las competencias tic de los estudiantes por otro. Durante estos estudios han aparecido dos problemas: los hallazgos son inconclusos y que la mayor{\'i}a de las evaluaciones tic se han hecho desde la misma perspectiva del estudiante, por lo cual contienen un sesgo autoinformado. El siguiente texto tiene como objetivo abordar ambos problemas, en primer caso midiendo de manera directa las competencias tic de estudiantes de primaria e investigando la relaci{\'o}n entre el g{\'e}nero y el nivel socioecon{\'o}mico adem{\'a}s de los resultados de los estudiantes en las pruebas, es decir, sus competencias reales en las tic. La prueba tuvo una muestra representativa de 378 estudiantes de sexto grado de 58 escuelas primarias. Los resultados indican que en general, los estudiantes de primaria tienen dificultades particulares en competencia tic de nivel superior, que se centran en comunicar de manera socialmente aceptable y claramente comprensible. Adem{\'a}s se constata que las ni{\~n}as tienen mejores habilidades tecnicas en tic que los ni{\~n}os. En cuanto al nivel socioecon{\'o}mico, los resultados demuestran que el nivel educativo de la madre est{\'a} relacionado positivamente con las habilidades tic de los estudiantes.\\
\\
En estudios anteriores se han desarrollado y utilizado varios instrumentos de autoinforme para medir determinados aspectos de las competencias TIC de los alumnos o las competencias TIC de los alumnos en general, como la escala de autoeficacia general en Internet (GISE) y la escala de autoeficacia comunicativa en Internet (CISE) de Liang y Tsai (2008), o la escala de exploraci{\'o}n en l{\'i}nea y comunicaci{\'o}n en l{\'i}nea de Tsai y Tsai (2010). Torkzadeh y Van Dyke (2002) han operacionalizado la autoeficacia en Internet como la confianza de los estudiantes en la navegaci{\'o}n, la manipulaci{\'o}n del sistema y el cifrado/descifrado. La escala Computer-Email-Web Fluency de Bunz (2004) mide la capacidad autopercibida de los alumnos en el uso general del ordenador, el uso del correo electr{\'o}nico, la navegaci{\'o}n por la Web y la edici{\'o}n Web.\\
\\
Principalmente se rescata de este texto, que a la hora de medir el uso de Tic en estudiantes, es importante tener primero en cuenta, que tipos de estudios se realizaron, si fueron respuestas propias de los estudiantes, o si fueron pruebas aplicadas al manejo de las tic de los estudiantes, siendo est{\'a} {\'u}ltima lo recomendado por el texto, ya que eliminar{\'i}a los sesgos autoinformados. Por otra parte, tomando en cuenta resultados anteriores, el estudio recomienda tomar en cuenta como variables el g{\'e}nero (ya que la literatura revela que las ni{\~n}as tienen mejor rendimiento que ni{\~n}os (ejm ver ICILS CHILE2018) y grupo socioecon{\'o}mico.}

  abstract = {The concept of computer self-efficacy (CSE) recently has been proposed as important to the study of individual behavior toward information technology. This paper extends current understanding about the concept of self-efficacy in the context of computer software. We describe how two broad types of computer self-efficacy beliefs, general self-efficacy and task-specific self-efficacy, are constructed across different computing tasks by suggesting that initial general CSE beliefs will strongly predict subsequent specific CSE beliefs. The theorized causal relationships illustrate the malleability and development of CSE beliefs over time, within a training environment where individuals are progressively provided with greater opportunity for hands-on experience and practice with different software. Consistent with the findings of prior research, judgments of self-efficacy then serve as key antecedents of the perceived cognitive effort (ease of use) associated with technology usage. Further, we theorize that self-efficacy judgments in the task domain of computing are strongly influenced by the extent to which individuals believe that they are personally innovative with respect to information technology. Panel data were collected using a longitudinal research design within a training context where 186 subjects were taught two software packages in a sequential manner over a 14-week period. The emergent patterns of the hypothesized relationships are examined using structural equation modeling techniques. Results largely support the relationships posited.},

Nonetheless, certain social-cognitive processes involved in role modeling tend to be overlooked. This oversight is puzzling given that these processes, such as retention and reproduction of modeled behavior, are of great importance to role modeling processes---the consideration and inclusion of such processes can provide crucial insight. This paper provides an overview of the role model research in education to date, detailing researchers' focus and emphasis on identifying aspects of role model effectiveness. We then analyze how including the component processes of social learning or observational theory can add value and application to advance role modeling research. Finally, we provide recommendations to close the gap between current research trends and what has been previously theorized on modeling to help inform ongoing future investigations.

Results of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, indicated that students' perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived autonomy related to ICT usage were significantly positively related to their enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science. Further, the results of the study revealed that students' perceived autonomy related to ICT usage was more strongly associated with their dispositions toward science than perceived competence in ICT usage.

The digital divide is a dynamic and constantly evolving concept of digital exclusion that encompasses numerous dimensions and levels. The ``usage access gap'' and the ``second-level divide'' both account for differences in how digitally divided people actually use technology. In this study, we employ social cognitive theory as a framework to explore the impact of various kinds of technology usage on predominately minority students' technology and application self-efficacy. Data were gathered over the course of a large-scale computing intervention that took place in an elementary school district in the southeastern United States. Results indicate that usage access gap activities and second-level divide activities, such as playing games or talking to friends online, may actually help increase students' technology self-efficacy and computer application self-efficacy. Entertainment and social networking activities provide students with positive direct experiences with technology, which may help close this dimension/level of the digital divide over time. Future computing interventions should consider establishing dedicated ``computer recess'' time to help digitally divided students increase their technology self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract{\enspace} The capacity to exercise control over the nature and quality of one's life is the essence of humanness. Human agency is characterized by a number of core features that operate through phenomenal and functional consciousness. These include the temporal extension of agency through intentionality and forethought, self-regulation by self-reactive influence, and self-reflectiveness about one's capabilities, quality of functioning, and the meaning and purpose of one's life pursuits. Personal agency operates within a broad network of sociostructural influences. In these agentic transactions, people are producers as well as products of social systems. Social cognitive theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: direct personal agency, proxy agency that relies on others to act on one's behest to secure desired outcomes, and collective agency exercised through socially coordinative and interdependent effort. Growing transnational embeddedness and interdependence are placing a premium on collective efficacy to exercise control over personal destinies and national life.},

  abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

Recognizing the multilevel nature of the computer self-efficacy (CSE), this study attempts to explore gender differences in the adoption of mobile learning, by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with general and specific CSE. Data collected from 137 university students were tested against the research model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results suggest that there are significant gender differences in perceptions of general CSE, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention to use but no significant differences in specific CSE, perceived usefulness. Additionally, the findings reveal that specific CSE is more salient than general CSE in influencing perceived ease of use, while general CSE seems to be the salient factor on perceived usefulness for both female and male combined. Moreover, general CSE was salient to determine the behavioral intention to use indirectly for female despite lower perception of general CSE than male's, and specific CSE exhibited stronger indirect effect on behavioral intention to use than general CSE for female despite similar perception of specific CSE as males'. These findings provide important implications for mobile learning adoption and usage.},

  abstract = {For many years, researchers studied executive functions (EFs) in the laboratory with a focus on understanding an individual child's development and brain processes in a controlled environment. Building on this foundational research, there is a growing interest in EFs in the context of a child's dynamic, social world, and the contextual and compositional factors influencing EF development. This paper provides a descriptive view of EFs in 1112 K-3 children from six schools in Phoenix, AZ, USA. The study's goals were to examine (1) variation in EF scores between and within schools and classrooms, (2) predictors of variation in children's spring EF scores, and (3) individual and compositional predictors of children's spring EF scores. Our findings indicate greater variation in children's EF within schools than between, with very little or no variation arising from differences between schools. Though we observed greater variation within classrooms than between them, a notable amount of variance in children's spring EF scores appears to arise from differences between classrooms. Classroom-level variables, including a fall leave-out classroom mean (without the students' own score) and the number of children in the top or bottom grade-level quartiles in each classroom, were significant predictors of variation in spring EF scores as well as in fall to spring changes in EF. In some cases, the classroom variables were stronger predictors than individual fall scores. Findings suggest that understanding variation and cultivating growth in EF skills requires intervention, measurement, and analytic approaches that extend beyond the individual to include compositional features of the classroom environment. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Variation in children's EF scores (n~=~1112 children) was greater within schools (n~=~6 schools) than between, with very little or no variance arising from differences between schools. While variance was greater within classrooms than between (n~=~67 classrooms), a notable amount of variance in children's spring EF scores appears to arise from differences between classrooms. Classroom-level variables (e.g., leave-out mean, number of children in the top or bottom grade-level quartiles in each classroom) were significant predictors of variation and of changes in spring EF outcomes. In some cases, the classroom variables were stronger predictors of spring EF than individual fall scores.},

If students had had a positive experience in their first CS course, they had a stronger intention to take another CS course. A subset of 128 students (68 females and 60 males) took a CS course up to one year later. Students who were interested in CS, had high computer self-efficacy, were low in family orientation, low in conscientiousness, and low in openness to experiences were more likely to take CS courses. Furthermore, individuals who were highly conscientious and low in relational-interdependent self-construal earned the highest CS grades. Efforts to improve women's representation in CS should bear these results in mind.},

This experience is measured by period of time using a computer and self-perceived computer and Internet experience. Further analyses on the impact of gender on this correlation of ICT experience and ICT attitudes were conducted by means of a multivariate model. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of gender, computer use, and self-perceived computer experience on computer anxiety attitudes, as well as several significant interaction effects. Males were found to have less computer anxiety than females; respondents who have used computers for a longer period of time and respondents with a higher self-perception of experience also show less computer anxiety. However, the GLM plot shows that the influence of computer experience works in different ways for males and females. Computer experience has a positive impact on decreasing computer anxiety for men, but a similar effect was not found for women. The model was also tested for computer liking and Internet-liking factors.}

Results indicate that age, gender and education, in particular, are major factors structuring the digital divide. So pervasive is the presence of age differences in the literature that many observers believe that the digital divide is basically a generational phenomenon that, in time, will disappear as younger computer literate cohorts replace older non-users. However, some researchers call this assumption into question. Moreover, the dominant focus on socio-demographics has led to a relative neglect of psychological factors as possible explanations for differential adoption and use of ICT. Consequently, the present study employs the social cognitive and self-efficacy theories of Bandura (1986, 1997) and the locus of control construct of Rotter (1966) in order to investigate some psychological correlates of the digital divide among a representative sample of Flemish adolescents (n=1145). The results indicate that computer locus of control and ICT self-efficacy supplement socio-demographic explanations of the digital divide. The results, however, are gender specific, indicating that there are different processes operating for males and females.}

  abstract = {Over the last 18 months, media coverage has revealed a concern that the increasing proliferation of digital learning at all universities (amplified by COVID-19 lockdowns) has compounded access and participation barriers for students impoverished by socio-economic challenges. This reflects  the importance of digital capital as an aspect of learner disadvantage (Park, 2017) and increased understanding of intersectional disadvantage (Nichols and Stahl, 2019), through which digital disadvantage may add to pre-existing inequalities. The Quality Assurance Agency (2020) report how  institutional action against digital poverty correlates with greater student satisfaction and higher levels of attainment. This article synthesises data from the authors' scholarship into digital barriers facing adult students returning to education. Challenges in relation to disposable income  often compound challenges intersecting with other aspects of disadvantage (Butcher and Rose-Adams, 2015), and a lack of confidence and inadequate digital readiness amongst learners from disadvantaged backgrounds seeking an Access entry route has been identified (Curry and Butcher, 2020; Fowle  and Butcher, 2019; Butcher and Fowle, 2018). Recommendations are made to promote greater inclusion amongst students from poor socio-economic backgrounds and to support the progression of a more diverse (and representative) adult learner cohort.},

  annotation = {The paper is a synthesis of quantitative reasearch about gender attitudes of technology use. This because the authors see that there's inconsistent results about this theme, so it's necesary to resume all the findings.\\
\\
To say something about tendencies of change in attitudinal gender technology issue: "As shown in the synthesis by Whitley (1997), despite the inconsistencies among the individual studies, the research findings generally suggested that males showed more favorable attitudes toward technology use than females, confirming the general perception that gender differences existed with regard to technology use. Such gender difference might partially explain the gender gap in technology use and in the technology workforce. This observation and conclusion, however, may not remain valid after almost two decades, during which the society has witnessed the fast development and wide use of technology in all aspects of the society. As Tsai and Lin (2004) discussed, with the increasing ubiquity of technology and its prominence, changes related to technology use could have occurred; with more females acquiring more experiences related to technology, gender differences regarding technology use, including the attitudes toward technology use, could have been narrowing over the years."\\
\\
Definition of attitude and classification: "In general, ``attitudes'' could be defined as ``people's global evaluations of any object, such as oneself, other people, possessions, issues, abstract concepts, and so forth'' (Petty, Fabrigar, \& Wegener, 2003, p.752), and such ``global evaluation'' may consist of different facets: affect (Emotional), beliefs (Cognitive), and self-efficacy (Behavourial capability) (Whitley, 1997).\\
\\
Definition of techonolical self-efficacy: "``Self-efficacy'' is generally known as the ``generative capability in which cognitive, social and behavioral sub-skills must be organized into integrated courses of action to serve innumerable purpose'' (Bandura, 1982). In terms of technology use, ``self-efficacy'' refers to peoples' belief in their own abilities to undertake a technology-related task successfully (McDonald \& Siegall, 1992)."\\
\\
Literature revision divide on this three dimensions\\
\\
Affective:\\
- greater anxiety amon females\\
- boys have more interest and  (Durndell and Haag, 2002, Jackson et al., 2001, Schottenbauer et al., 2004).enjoyment(Colley \& Comber, 2003)\\
\\
beliefs:\\
- boys have more positive perceptions than girls to ict\\
\\
Capabilities:\\
- Literature have no one consistent result about gender differences\\
\\
The model of the study favours en in belief and self-efficacy, but non-significant results in affective variable. Minimal reduction of the gap compared to wilthley 1997 study. The most reducted gap is in self eficcacy. Attitudinal gap favours men more in secondary school than in other parts. Is the place with the largest gap. No regional differences.}

Digital gender gaps can exist in students' access to and use of ICT, attitudes toward technology, and digital knowledge and skills.

  annotation = {Researchers divide three type of gapes and study them in school and individual level. First gender gap is about access and attitudes to technologies. Second one's about digital knowledge and skills, and third gender divide is on differences of outcomes with technology (Educational or labourhood). Then try to explain how attitudes differences are related with performance in digital knowledge and skills.\\
\\
In the present study, we synthesize the evidence on the gender differences in digital skills after controlling for ICT access and attitudes toward technology. \\
\\
Moreover, we examine the mediating role of students' attitudes toward technology (see Fig. 1). In this study, we address the following research questions: 1. To what extent are gender differences in digital skills mediated by attitudes toward technology? 2. To what extent do the direct and indirect effects of gender on digital skills via attitudes toward technology vary across primary studies, countries, and types of attitudes toward technology? 3. To what extent do study, country, and measurement characteristics explain this heterogeneity?\\
\\
The present study addresses these gaps by employing an integrative data analysis (IDA) approach using individual participant data (IPD) from the 2013 and 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS).\\
\\
Something interesting from this study is they use CIL and CT test from icils as digital skills\\
\\
Distinct different attitudinal variables on icils:\\
- Affective: Intrinsic motivation and enjoyment (2013).\\
- Beliefs: Positive and negative outcome and expectations of future use.\\
- Selefficacy: Basic and advance.\\
\\
Results:\\
These findings showed that girls outperformed boys in digital skills, even after controlling for ICT access and affect. As the indirect effect of gender on digital skills via ICT affect was positive and different from zero, there was evidence for at least partial mediation of gender differences\\
\\
The ICT attitudes dimension of affect and beliefs also partially mediated the relation between gender and digital skills. Students' positive attitudes and interest in ICT are determinants of students' digital skills development (Erdogdu \& Erdogdu, 2022). However, gender gaps in favor of boys in the dimensions of affect and attitudes toward ICT have been reported in the literature (Cai et al., 2017). This integrative data analysis found a gender gap favoring boys in the ICT affect and beliefs dimensions. Furthermore, we found that boys with equal ICT access than girls performed better in digital skills partly due to differences in interest and positive attitudes toward ICT. Prior research on gender differences in digital skills showed that girls had a higher performance than boys (Siddiq \& Scherer, 2019), however, our findings indicate that the magnitude of the gender gaps in digital skills seems to reverse once interest and positive attitudes are considered. These results confirm the link between the first- and second-level gender digital divide and emphasize the need to address gender differences in attitudes toward technology to achieve digital equity.\\
\\
Taken together, the results of this research point to the link between the firstand second-level gender digital divide. The gender gaps in digital knowledge and skills could be partly explained by gender differences in attitudes toward technology.\\
\\
Overall, our findings indicate that the digital divide is not uniform across countries and samples, providing evidence about the variability of gender gaps in digital skills and attitudes toward technology, as reported in previous meta-analyses}

Self-efficacy beliefs have been identified as a factor that may contribute to the success with which a task is completed. Because of the increasing reliance on computer technologies in all aspects of life, it is important that the construct is measured accurately and appropriately. In particular, the article focuses on the measurement of computer self-efficacy (CSE) in student computer users and its relevance to learning in higher education. The scale was found to have high levels of internal and external reliability and construct validity. Results also showed there to be significant positive correlations between CSE and computer experience, and familiarity with computer software packages (which were significant predictors of CSE), and that owning a computer and computer training increased CSE. In addition, males showed significantly higher CSE than females. It is suggested that the scale may be used to identify individuals, in particular students, who will find it difficult to exploit a learning environment that relies heavily on computer technologies. Once identified, motivational and personal control issues can be addressed with these individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present work analyzes the relationship between self-concept, self-efficacy, and subjective well-being in native and migrant adolescents in Santiago de Chile.

Student's {$<$}italic{$>$}t{$<$}/italic{$>$}-tests were used to compare the average of the constructs evaluated between natives/migrants and boys/girls participants. Subsequently, two multivariate models of simple mediation were constructed, one for natives and another for migrants, which assumed subjective well-being as a dependent variable, academic self-concept as an independent variable and the general self-efficacy as a mediating variable. In both models, gender was considered as a control variable. Results show that migrant students present higher levels of academic self-concept and general self-efficacy than native students. There are no differences with regard to well-being. In the case of gender, differences are observed only for the case of general self-efficacy, where boys present higher levels. On the other hand, a partial mediation is observed for the model of native students and a total mediation for the model of migrant students. The study yielded interesting results regarding the differences in the evaluation of the constructs of self-concept, self-efficacy, and subjective well-being in both groups.

It places develop-ing countries in a disadvantaged position economically, politically, and socially that in turns affects the life and social well-being of the citizens. Current understanding of the digital divide is limited by usage of sec-ondary data, which prompts scholars to call for more theoretically-based empirical research. Since the key to reducing the digital divide is to increase people's access to ICT, this study developed and empiri-cally tested a 3-tier ICT access model to determine the effect on ICT development of intention to par-ticipate in online activities among citizens in developed and developing countries. The model was founded on three existing research frameworks. In addition, this study theoretically clarified the relationship between four types of ICT access and how they contribute to intention to participate online. Survey data of university students from Korea and Cambodia was collected. The results confirm the effect of ICT development on citizens' intention and isolate key factors that impact the two countries differently. Tech-nological access was found to impact extrinsic motivational access and skills access. Social access influ-enced extrinsic and intrinsic motivational access and skills access. Implications for research and practice are discussed. A country's development index plays an important role in affecting the digital divide.}

Students' self-efficacy in using ICT has been shown to contribute to their ICT literacy. However, research on the correlates of ICT self-efficacy has been insufficient, resulting in often oversimplified causal statements. This study investigated the relationship between adolescents' interest in ICT and their ICT self-efficacy at age fifteen based on data from 30 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries that participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. Altogether, the participants include 201,652 students from 7708 schools, all of whom completed the ICT Familiarity Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using multilevel mediation, with interest in ICT as the independent variable, perceived ICT competence at age fifteen as the dependent variable, and several ICT-related behavioral factors, including ICT use at school (USESCH), ICT use outside of school for schoolwork (HOMESCH), ICT use outside of school for leisure (ENTUSE), and ICT use in social interaction (SOIAICT), as the mediating variables. The results showed a significantly positive relationship between adolescents' interest in ICT and their ICT self-efficacy at age fifteen and that this relationship was partially mediated by behavioral factors. ICT use at home and ICT use at school were not significant mediators for any of the 30 OECD countries while ICT use for recreation and ICT use for social interaction were significant for most countries. The practical implications of these findings are discussed, and suggestions are offered.},

We propose that students' stereotypes about the culture of these fields---including the kind of people, the work involved, and the values of the field---steer girls away from choosing to enter them. Computer science and engineering are stereotyped in modern American culture as male-oriented fields that involve social isolation, an intense focus on machinery, and inborn brilliance. These stereotypes are compatible with qualities that are typically more valued in men than women in American culture. As a result, when computer science and engineering stereotypes are salient, girls report less interest in these fields than their male peers. However, altering these stereotypes---by broadening the representation of the people who do this work, the work itself, and the environments in which it occurs---significantly increases girls' sense of belonging and interest in the field. Academic stereotypes thus serve as gatekeepers, driving girls away from certain fields and constraining their learning opportunities and career aspirations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The paper presents an operational definition of ICT skills, an instrument measuring these skills as well as the students' results in the test. The definition of ICT skills used considers Chile's curricular framework, functional and cognitive skills. Specifically, ICT skills were defined as the capacity to solve problems of information, communication and knowledge in digital environments. A performance-based assessment was designed in a virtual environment to measure these skills. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of students were able to solve tasks related to the use of information as consumers, i.e., approximately three quarters of the students were able to search for information and half of them were also able to organize and manage digital information. Additionally, they show that very few students were able to succeed in tasks related to the use of information as producers, i.e., only one third of the students were able to develop their own ideas in a digital environment and less than one fifth were able to refine digital information and create a representation in a digital environment. Socioeconomic group, access, daily use and confidence in doing ICT-related activities were all positively associated with higher scores, showing the need to implement strategies to compensate this inequality, possibly by explicitly defining these aims in the national curriculum.},

"In synthesis, the data regarding Chilean 15-year-old students access and use of ICT shows that although schools are still important in terms of access to computers for lower SEGs, with regard to frequency and type of use, they do not seem to be playing a significant role." --{$>$} School is not important for self efficacy differences\\
\\
\\
School effect always is researched as SES condition, but no as gender composition condition. This paper is part of this tendency, so we can justify the model. In SES condition there no more effect: "In addition, as ICT availability has increased in homes, the role of schools in terms of access to ICT has been decreasing, to the level that only 10\% of students in this study reported learning to use computers at school. Even more, frequency of use at school resulted low for all SEGs and much lower than its use at home, implying that ICT-related activities at school could have a relatively lower impact in individual differences. These results are consistent with the international evidence showing a low, inexistent or negative relation between ICT use at school and students' academic performance"\\

The argument is that the institution that sought to give sustainability to this policy over time, ended up losing its ability to lead relevant responses to the educational challenges posed by the growing digitalization of the Chilean society. To develop this argument, first we describe the main characteristics, history and results of Enlaces until 2018, and second, we analyze the institutional development of Enlaces in light of the challenges posed to ICT in education policies in the world.},

  abstract = {The present study examined possible changes in the computer experience and attitudes of 11-12-year-old and 15-16-year-old students following a period in which ICT has become much more widely used in the school curriculum. In comparison with findings from a similar study undertaken in the early 1990s, there was some evidence of a reduced gender gap, particularly in the use of computers for applications such as word-processing, graphics, programming and maths. In addition, more recently introduced applications such as e-mail, accessing the internet and using CD-ROMs showed no overall gender difference in frequency of use. However, some gender differences remained, particularly in attitudes. Boys still liked computers more, were more self-confident in their use and, unlike previously, sex-typed them less than girls. They also used computers more frequently out of school, particularly for playing games. There was some evidence that, as found previously, older girls held the least positive attitudes, and it is suggested that their approach to computers may be influenced by the cultural pressures of gender stereotyping. More general age differences in use and attitudes were also found, and these may result from the different computing applications used by Year 7 and Year 11 pupils at school. In summary, although we found evidence of some change since the early 1990s, increased exposure to computes has not closed the gender gap.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the role of individuals' beliefs about their abilities to competently use computers (computer self-efficacy) in the determination of computer use. A survey of Canadian managers and professionals was conducted to develop and validate a measure of computer self-efficacy and to assess both its impacts and antecedents. Computer self-efficacy was found to exert a significant influence on individuals' expectations of the outcomes of using computers, their emotional reactions to computers (affect and anxiety), as well as their actual computer use. An individual's self-efficacy and outcome expectations were found to be positively influenced by the encouragement of others in their work group, as well as others' use of computers. Thus, self-efficacy represents an important individual trait, which moderates organizational influences (such as encouragement and support) on an individual's decision to use computers. Understanding self-efficacy, then, is important to the successful implementation of systems in organizations. The existence of a reliable and valid measure of self-efficacy makes assessment possible and should have implications for organizational support, training, and implementation.}

However, digital skills remain as a stumbling block to achieve digital inclusion. Using a two-wave panel survey on a representative sample conducted in Chile between 2018 and 2020, this study investigates how different mode of access (i.e. mobile-only vs mobile and computer) affects digital abilities over time. Results show significant differences in skills by mode of access. People who became hybrid users (mobile and computer) by wave 2 significantly gained skills while those who were hybrid and became mobile-only by wave 2 significantly lost abilities. People who did not change their type of access did not change their level of digital skills, despite the past of time and gained experience using the Internet. These conclusions show how mode of access may have a key effect on people's digital inclusion.},

Nonetheless, concerns arose regarding their role in the creation of new digital underclass related to the capital-enhancing consequences of Internet use. Among these, e-government engagement allows individuals to reduce the administrative burdens of governmental interactions. Nonetheless, its uptake has been proven to be highly stratified in Latin American countries where most services are not digital-by-default. The article argues that disparities in digital access play a role in this e-government divides. It examines the antecedents and determinants of household computer access and mobile-only Internet use, and e-government engagement in Brazil. Based on ``TIC Domicilios 2019'' survey, using logistic regressions to predict household access to computers, mobile-only Internet access, and e-government engagement. Mediation analyses of the latter models are conducted, testing the sequential nature of socio-digital inequalities based on the DiSTO framework. Findings show that living in a household with computers reduces the chances of being a mobile-only user and increases the odds of e-government engagement. Mobile-only access reduces e-government engagement. The effects of socioeconomic status and digital inequalities are mediated by household access to computers and mobile-only use. Implications for digital inclusion policies are discussed.},

Little consensus exists regarding when these associations begin to develop and what may lead to changes over time. This study examined whether gender-STEM implicit associations of college women majoring in male-dominated STEM fields are less stereotypical than those who choose non-STEM, people-oriented, female-dominated majors (FDMs), whether these associations might differ between students at the start and end of their degree program, and whether these associations are related to previous STEM-relevant educational experiences or explicit STEM-gender associations. A Career Identity Implicit Association Test (IAT) measured implicit associations between personal identities and career choices and a Gender-Career IAT measured implicit associations between gender groups and careers in a sample of 240 college women (half STEM majors, half FDMs) who completed the study online. Half of each major group was composed of first year students and half were more advanced students (third year or beyond). We also assessed explicit gender-STEM stereotypes and early educational experiences related to STEM. Results indicated more counter-stereotypical associations for personal career identity and gender-career stereotypes among STEM women compared to non-STEM women, with no effect for year in school. Higher quality STEM educational experiences were also associated with counter-stereotypical scores on both IATs. Counterintuitively, explicit gender-STEM associations were related to less stereotypical scores on the Career-Identity IAT. Unexpectedly, STEM majors and advanced students reported more pronounced explicit gender-STEM associations than FDM majors and first-year students. Both IAT scores and early educational experiences predicted major choice. These results have novel implications for interventions that encourage women's participation in STEM.},

Significant gender effects were found throughout, with males tending to report greater computer self efficacy, lower computer anxiety, more positive attitudes towards the Internet and longer use of the Internet than females. However, regression analysis indicted that reported Internet experience (use) was the only variable independently linked to gender. It is argued that the results tend to support the contention that the literature on attitudes and anxiety towards computers is liable to extrapolate to the Internet. In particular this may apply to the gender dimension of this literature. It is also argued that the countries of Eastern Europe may now be manifesting the gender variations in relation to technology that are found in Western Europe.},

In polls inquiring about communion (e.g., affectionate, emotional), agency (e.g., ambitious, courageous), and competence (e.g., intelligent, creative), respondents indicated whether each trait is more true of women or men, or equally true of both. Women's relative advantage in communion increased over time, but men's relative advantage in agency showed no change. Belief in competence equality increased over time, along with belief in female superiority among those who indicated a sex difference in competence. Contemporary gender stereotypes thus convey substantial female advantage in communion and a smaller male advantage in agency but also gender equality in competence along with some female advantage. Interpretation emphasizes the origins of gender stereotypes in the social roles of women and men. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles.

  abstract = {Members of social categories defined by attributes such as sex, race, and age occupy certain types of social roles much more than members of other social categories do. The qualities that define these roles become associated with the category as a whole, thus forming a stereotype. In a vicious cycle, this stereotype then hinders category members' movement into roles with different demands because their stereotype portrays them as well matched to their existing roles but not to these new roles. This vicious cycle has important implications for stereotype change. Given the difficulties of producing enduring change by directly attacking stereotypes in the minds of individuals, a more effective strategy consists of policies and programs that change the distributions of category members in roles, thereby changing stereotypes at their source. If the vicious cycle is not interrupted by such social change, observations of category members' typical social roles continually reinstate existing stereotypes.}

  abstract = {Perceived self-efficacy was introduced by Bandura (1977) as ``an integrative theoretical framework to explain and predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment'' (p. 191). Subsequent empirical studies appear to support the contention that self-efficacy ratings on specific behavioral tasks are accurate predictors of subsequent behavioral performance on those tasks. In this paper we examine the conceptual basis of self-efficacy theory. In particular, the distinction between outcome and efficacy expectations is analyzed in relation to fear and avoidant behavior. We conclude that self-efficacy theory is conceptually problematic and, in particular, that the central concept of efficacy expectations is not unambiguously differentiated from outcome expectations, despite Bandura's (1978) claim to the contrary. Similarly, we suggest that what is actually being assessed in the empirical studies is unclear. We conclude that the empirical findings are less impressive when the circumscribed nature of the behavioral tasks is recognized. Finally, we suggest that resolutions of both the conceptual and methodological difficulties are necessary before Bandura's (1978) claim, that self-efficacy is a unifying construct, can be properly evaluated.},

In this article, we discuss five ``macro'' level issues concerning the theory. Our broad purposes in taking this approach are to clarify some issues regarding the current status of the theory, make suggestions for next steps for research based in the theory, and justify our decision to call the theory Situated Expectancy-Value Theory (SEVT). First, we note how visual representations of the model make it appear static, linear, and monolithic, something that was not intended from its inception. Second, we discuss definitions of the major psychological constructs in the model, focusing on our and others' elaboration of the task value component, particularly the ``cost'' component. In this section we also discuss research on the development of expectancies and values. Third, we discuss the often-neglected middle part of the model focused on how individuals understand and interpret their own performance as well as the many messages they receive from different socializers regarding their activity participation and performance. In the fourth section we discuss the situative and culturally-focused aspects of the model, stressing the impact of the situation and cultural background on children's developing expectancy and value hierarchies. The fifth issue (one that we mention in several of the previous sections) concerns the importance of understanding the development of individuals' hierarchies of expectancies of success and subjective task values and how they relate to performance, choice, and engagement.},

Stereotypes about the way men and women think and behave are widely shared, suggesting a kernel of truth. However, stereotypical expectations not only reflect existing differences, but also impact the way men and women define themselves and are treated by others. This article reviews evidence on the nature and content of gender stereotypes and considers how these relate to gender differences in important life outcomes. Empirical studies show that gender stereotypes affect the way people attend to, interpret, and remember information about themselves and others. Considering the cognitive and motivational functions of gender stereotypes helps us understand their impact on implicit beliefs and communications about men and women. Knowledge of the literature on this subject can benefit the fair judgment of individuals in situations where gender stereotypes are likely to play a role.

An analysis of the latest data on educational outcomes among boys and girls reveals extensive disparities in grades, reading and writing test scores, and other measurable educational outcomes, and these disparities exist across family resources and race. Focusing on disadvantaged schoolchildren, I then examine whether time investments made by boys and girls related to computer use contribute to the gender gap in academic achievement. Data from several sources indicate that boys are less likely to use computers for schoolwork and are more likely to use computers for playing games, but are less likely to use computers for social networking and email than are girls. Using data from a large field experiment randomly providing free personal computers to schoolchildren for home use, I also test whether these differential patterns of computer use displace homework time and ultimately translate into worse educational outcomes among boys. No evidence is found indicating that personal computers crowd out homework time and effort for disadvantaged boys relative to girls. Home computers also do not have negative effects on educational outcomes such as grades, test scores, courses completed, and tardies for disadvantaged boys relative to girls.},

  abstract = {Over the years, a variety of frameworks, models and literacies have been developed to guide teacher educators in their efforts to build digital capabilities in their students, that will support them to use new and emerging technologies in their future classrooms. Generally, these focus on advancing students' skills in using `educational' applications and digitally-sourced information, or understanding effective blends of pedagogical, content and technological knowledge seen as supporting the integration of digital resources into teaching, to enhance subject learning outcomes. Within teacher education institutions courses developing these capabilities are commonly delivered as standalone entities, or there is an assumption that they will be generated by technology's integration in other disciplines or through mandated assessment. However, significant research exists suggesting the current narrow focus on subject-related technical and information skills does not prepare students adequately with the breadth of knowledge and capabilities needed in today's classrooms, and beyond. This article presents a conceptual framework introducing an expanded view of teacher digital competence (TDC). It moves beyond prevailing technical and literacies conceptualisations, arguing for more holistic and broader-based understandings that recognise the increasingly complex knowledge and skills young people need to function ethically, safely and productively in diverse, digitally-mediated environments. The implications of the framework are discussed, with specific reference to its interdisciplinary nature and the requirement of all faculty to engage purposefully and deliberately in delivering its objectives. Practical suggestions on how the framework might be used by faculty, are presented.},

ICILS seeks to establish how well schools around the globe are responding to the need to provide young people with the necessary digital participatory competencies. Effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is an imperative for successful participation in an increasingly digital world. ICILS 2018 explores international differences in students' computer and information literacy (CIL), namely their ability to use computers to investigate, create, and communicate at home, at school, in the workplace, and in the community. Participating countries also had an option to administer an assessment of students' computational thinking (CT), focused on their ability to recognize aspects of real-world problems appropriate for computational formulation, and to evaluate and develop algorithmic solutions to those problems, so that the solutions could be operationalized with a computer. The data collected by ICILS 2018 show how digital competencies can be assessed using instruments representing authentic contexts for ICT use, and how students' CIL and CT skills relate to school learning experiences, out-of-school contexts, and student characteristics. Those data also show how learning technologies are used in classrooms around the world. Background questionnaires asked students about their use of ICT, and collected information from teachers, schools, and national education systems about the resourcing and teaching of CIL (and CT) within their countries. The results of ICILS 2018 will enable policymakers and education systems to develop a better understanding of the contexts and outcomes of CIL (and CT) education programs.},

  abstract = {As computer and information technologies increasingly dominate modern life, educators and policymakers recognize the importance of ensuring that all students are able to use computers to investigate, create, and communicate effectively. Intriguingly, results from IEA's International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) of grade eight students, undertaken in 2013, indicated that female students generally had higher computer and information literacy (CIL) scale scores than male students.

An analysis of differential item functioning indicated that female students generally performed relatively better on tasks that involved communication, design, and creativity, while male students generally performed relatively better on more technical tasks, and those concerned with security. Female students took a little longer to complete the test than male students; this may have contributed to their better scores. While there were few differences between female and male students' basic information and communications technologies (ICT) self-efficacy, on average, male students recorded higher specialized ICT self-efficacy than female students in all 14 countries, and the difference was moderate to large in 12 of the 14 countries. General ICT self-efficacy was positively associated with both male and female CIL achievement to a similar extent in all 14 countries. Advanced ICT self-efficacy, however, was less strongly and less consistently related to CIL achievement.},

While teachers are encouraged to integrate ICT into their teaching, there is evidence that the effectiveness of this integration depends to a large extent on teachers' preparedness to do so, which is directly related to their confidence and knowledge in using ICT, as well as their beliefs about the value of ICT in education. Female teachers using technology effectively provide a role model for young women at school, however previous studies have shown that female teachers are less likely to be using computers personally than their male counterparts. The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 teacher questionnaire provides a rich resource of data on teacher characteristics in relation to computer and information literacy and technology by gender. Analyses of female and male teachers' experiences, dispositions, and uses of ICT indicate that any differences are small and inconsistent across countries. Female and male teachers in secondary school do not appear to differ greatly in the extent of their pedagogical use of ICT.},

Moreover, male students were more confident than female students in their ability to perform specialized ICT tasks.

Design This review employed a meta-analytic technique. Method a meta-analysis with random effects model was performed on 24 effects. Publication bias was tested through funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Results Findings show a symmetric distribution of effects, making it possible to conclude that no file-drawer problem affected the collected sample of effects. Aggregating the results of the reviewed studies, a medium effect of stereotype threat manipulation on women's sport performances emerged (d\,=\,0.33). Collected studies were coded for stereotypicality of threatened exercise. The effect of stereotype threat was significantly higher for sports activities perceived as masculine. Conclusions This meta-analysis reveals that gender stereotype affects the sport activities of women and that this is particularly true for sports typically considered suited to males.}

Two important findings emerge from this research. First, greater ethnic diversity in classrooms and schools reduces students' feelings of victimization and vulnerability, because there is more balance of power among different ethnic groups. Second, in nondiverse classrooms where one ethnic group enjoys a numerical majority, victimized students who are members of the ethnic group that is in the majority may be particularly vulnerable to self-blaming attributions. The usefulness of attribution theory as a conceptual framework and ethnicity as a context variable in studies of peer victimization are discussed.},

In this study (N = 130 children in 16 classrooms representing a subset of all children enrolled in these classrooms), results showed a significant cross-level interaction between classroom age composition and children's age, suggesting positive effects of greater variance in classroom age composition for younger but not older children. The interaction between behavior management (1 dimension of classroom quality) and classroom age composition was also significant, indicating that a wider distribution of classroom age composition was positively related to children's vocabulary gains within classrooms characterized by better behavior management. Practice or Policy Findings underscore the importance of children's social interactions with more knowledgeable conversational partners in promoting their vocabulary development and signify the need to help teachers learn how to manage children's behaviors so as to provide a classroom that is optimal for child learning.},

As predicted, men reported higher opportunity evaluation than women when no gender stereotypical information was presented, whereas men and women evaluated the business opportunity equally favorably when entrepreneurs were described using gender-neutral attributes. Interestingly, gender differences in opportunity evaluation were exacerbated when entrepreneurship was linked to masculine stereotypical information, and reversed in favor of women when entrepreneurship was linked to feminine stereotypical information.

In this article, Patricia Gurin, Eric Dey, Sylvia Hurtado, and Gerald Gurin explore the relationship between students' experiences with diverse peers in the college or university setting and their educational outcomes. Rooted in theories of cognitive development and social psychology, the authors present a framework for understanding how diversity introduces the relational discontinuities critical to identity construction and its subsequent role in fostering cognitive growth. Using both single- and multi-institutional data from the University of Michigan and the Cooperative Institutional Research Program, the authors go on to examine the effects of classroom diversity and informal interaction among African American, Asian American, Latino/a, and White students on learning and democracy outcomes. The results of their analyses underscore the educational and civic importance of informal interaction among different racial and ethnic groups during the college years. The authors offer their findings as evidence of the continuing importance of affirmative action and diversity efforts by colleges and universities, not only as a means of increasing access to higher education for greater numbers of students, but also as a means of fostering students' academic and social growth.},

Horizontal occupational segregation begins at the very moment in which women choose their degree since it will have a repercussion in their future for it affects their future decisions, their future working life, their fields of expertise and even there are learning methodologies linked to gender. The presence of stereotypes and role models affecting the occupational breakdown by gender are catalysts of the intrinsic constraints (internalized beliefs) and extrinsic constraints (those linked to the norms and existing procedures, or the absence of them in higher education), since they discourage the irruption of women in fields which have been traditionally associated to men. With regards to higher education, women tend to enroll in the fields of health, education and social services whilst men focus on STEM fields. It is important to highlight that in Chile there are more women who enroll in the university regardless of the nature of the institution. However, there are fields of knowledge in which the gender gap is sharp. According to the data gathered by the Subsecretar{\'i}a de Educaci{\'o}n Superior of Chile, the gender gap in basic sciences is -0.1\% whilst it reaches a -65.7\% in Technology.},

Have gender stereotypes changed over this time period to reflect the new realities? And, to what extent does gender stereotyping exist today? We address these questions by comparing data collected in the early 1980s to new data collected in 2014. In each study, participants rated the likelihood that a typical man or woman has a set of gendered characteristics (traits, role behaviors, occupations, and physical characteristics). Results indicate that people perceive strong differences between men and women on stereotype components today, as they did in the past. Comparisons between the two time periods show stability of gender stereotypes across all components except female gender roles, which showed a significant increase in gender stereotyping. These results attest to the durability of basic stereotypes about how men and women are perceived to differ, despite changes in the participation and acceptance of women and men in nontraditional domains. Because gender stereotypes are apparently so deeply embedded in our society, those in a position to evaluate women and men, as well as women and men themselves, need to be constantly vigilant to the possible influence of stereotypes on their judgments, choices, and actions.

  abstract = {Increasingly more research is exploring how digital media can be used for teaching but is largely focused on how teachers shape technology use. Besides teachers in the classroom, parents at home may also have a pivotal role in shaping students' beliefs towards digital media which are in turn an important precursor to students' use of technology for learning. Previous research shows parent factors are related to students' ICT self-efficacy; however, the underlying mechanisms explaining these relations are less clear. Following Eccles et al.'s parent socialization model (1983), we investigate whether parents' behaviors including modeling and provision of digital media mediate the relation between parents' beliefs regarding digital media and students' digital media self-efficacy. Data were drawn from parent and student questionnaires collected as part of a study to investigate conditions for successful digital media use in classrooms (N~=~1206 students and their parents). Results show while parents' beliefs are related to students' digital media self-efficacy, only parents' provision of smart phones mediates this relation. Findings indicate the importance of parents' beliefs regarding digital media and the need for future research into at home factors that influence students' digital media self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {Objective. The literature on gender and technology use finds that women and men differ significantly in their attitudes toward their technological abilities. Concurrently, existing work on science and math abilities of students suggests that such perceived differences do not always translate into actual disparities. We examine the yet-neglected area concerning gender differences with respect to Internet-use ability. In particular, we test how self-perceived abilities are related to actual abilities and how these may differ by gender. Methods. We use new data on web-use skill to test empirically whether there are differences in men's and women's abilities to navigate online content. We draw on a diverse sample of adult Internet users to investigate the questions raised. Results. Findings suggest that men and women do not differ greatly in their online abilities. However, we find that women's self-assessed skill is significantly lower than that of men. Conclusions. Women's lower self-assessment regarding their web-use skills may affect significantly the extent of their online behavior and the types of uses to which they put the medium. We discuss the implications of these findings for social inequality.},

It is proposed that gender stereotypes and the expectations they produce about both what women are like (descriptive) and how they should behave (prescriptive) can result in devaluation of their performance, denial of credit to them for their successes, or their penalization for being competent. The processes giving rise to these outcomes are explored, and the procedures that are likely to encourage them are identified. Because of gender bias and the way in which it influences evaluations in work settings, it is argued that being competent does not ensure that a woman will advance to the same organizational level as an equivalently performing man.

Its central argument is that gender stereotypes give rise to biased judgments and decisions, impeding women's advancement. The paper discusses how descriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias because of the negative performance expectations that result from the perception that there is a poor fit between what women are like and the attributes believed necessary for successful performance in male gender-typed positions and roles. It also discusses how prescriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias by creating normative standards for behavior that induce disapproval and social penalties when they are directly violated or when violation is inferred because a woman is successful. Research is presented that tests these ideas, considers specific career consequences likely to result from stereotype-based bias, and identifies conditions that exaggerate or minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.}

Classroom management was found to moderate the association between academic classroom composition and the parental education--grade relationship, indicating a noticeable grade advantage of students with high parental education in classrooms with both an unfavorable academic composition and ineffective classroom management. Our findings highlight the relevance of classroom composition and classroom management to research on teachers' grading and point toward possible ways to improve current grading practices.

The results of t test statistical analyses, which examined only gender differences in demonstrated and perceived ICT skills, indicate significant differences in all areas in favor of females. Females had higher factor scores in perception measures for Frequency of Computer Use, Perceived ICT Skills, and Attitudes toward Computers. In addition, female students had significantly higher scores on all six sections from the Student Tool for Technology Literacy, a performance-based assessment. These results counter many empirical research studies that show males generally perform better with ICT skills and have overall better attitudes toward computers than their female counterparts. However, when adding predictors to the model and using multilevel modeling statistical methods, findings indicate that gender was no longer significant. These findings question the importance of the gender differences related to ICT skills that were found with previous statistical examinations. Using more advanced statistical methods to answer research questions pertaining to ICT skills is important in order to determine which factors have the greatest potential for intervention programs that focus on developing equitable ICT skills and career choices for all students.},

It argues that digital technologies change the context for individuals' careers and the opportunities that exist for the provision of career support. The implications of digital technologies for career are dependent, in part, on how technologies are believed to interact with society. They may be thought of as tools, as shapers of society, or as social practices. For individuals, digital technologies can be understood through six metaphors: (1) library, (2) media channel, (3) surveillance camera, (4) marketplace, (5) meeting place, and (6) arena. For career development professionals, the choice is using them to provide information, automated interactions, or communication. The chapter concludes by arguing that there are three main pedagogic stances (instrumental, connectivist, or critical) that can guide career development professionals in the combination of different technologies and in the resolution of the opportunities and challenges that are presented to individuals in their career building.},

In order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) goal 4, that is, to ensure quality education for all, to make educational resources and online learning are indispensable, and to access these resources anytime, anywhere through the Internet. In addition, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has made online education more necessary than ever before. Where and how ICT is used may have an impact on the components of motivation, such as self-efficacy and persistence. In this study, we quantified the impact of ICT utilization on the two components of self-efficacy and persistence. The effects of ICT use on both components were analyzed from the data taken from the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) administered to 15-year old students. The results revealed that students who frequently utilized ICT for the purpose of out-of-school learning, particularly for activities related to school projects, exhibited significantly higher levels of self-efficacy and persistence. The frequency of ICT usage for in-school learning revealed no effect on any of the two above components. In addition, utilization of ICT for recreational purposes outside of school showed significantly lower values in the area of persistence. These results indicate that it is important to set tasks that provide a continuum of ICT use, both in and out of school, in order to motivate learners. This has important implications for the design of learning in online education. Furthermore, it suggests that teachers should design exploratory type lessons that focus on strengthening students' desire to learn outside of class.},

  abstract = {Knowledge and skills with information and communications technology (ICT) usage are an essential part of modern life. In recent years, the age at which children have their first contact with ICT and first use of ICT has been decreasing. This can significantly affect the development of their digital literacy. This study investigates the relationship between the age at which children start using a computer and the degree of their perceived ICT competence and autonomy at the age of fifteen. It proposes a multiple mediator model within which the investigated relationship is mediated by ICT usage, ICT interest, and the degree to which ICT is a part of students' everyday social interactions. The model is then tested using data from 21 European OECD countries. The test results show that children who start using a computer at a later age (after the age of seven) demonstrate significantly lower ICT competence and ICT autonomy at the age of fifteen. The results of the mediation analysis suggest that the degree of ICT usage in the home environment for school purposes or activities seems less significant to the development of ICT competence and ICT autonomy than other studied ICT-related variables.},

  abstract = {Skills enabling and ensuring universal access to information have been investigated intensively during the past few years. The research results provide knowledge on the differences and digital divides. When examining ICT skill levels, the accuracy of assessment is one of the key issues to address the results and gain the applicable data for appropriate interventions to enhance digital inclusion. To date, ICT skill assessment is based mainly on self-reports and subjective evaluations. However, as previous studies have shown, people tend to overrate or underrate their own levels of competence. Thus, novel performance-based approach for assessing ICT skills is presented in this paper. The ICT skill test contains 42 tasks grouped into 17 ICT fields. The study was conducted with upper comprehensive and upper secondary level school students (n~=~3159) and their teachers (n~=~626) during years 2014--2016 in Finland. Using factor analysis, three ICT skills factors were created: basic digital skills, advanced technical skills, and professional ICT skills. The performance in the ICT skill test was also divided by gender, as the male students and teachers outperformed the female students and teacher. Outperformance also occurred by educational level, as both upper secondary level students and teachers were seen as possessing higher-level ICT skills than students and teachers at the comprehensive level. We thus argue that to compare the ICT skills and the validity of the assessments, we needed to ensure consistent assessment for both students and teachers. In addition, in order to diminish the ICT skill gap among students, interventions using formal education are urgently needed, and in particular, more attention should be given to both teacher training and in-service training.},

  abstract = {For half a century, psychologist Albert Bandura has worked to advance a cognitive interactional model of human functioning that emphasizes the role of cognitive and symbolic representations as central processes in human adaptation and change. In his seminal 1977 publication, Bandura emphasized that these representations -- visualized actions and outcomes stemming from reflective thought -- form the basis from which individuals assess their personal efficacy. An efficacy belief, he contended, is the ``conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes'' one desires (p. 193). Efficacy beliefs serve as the primary means by which people are able to exercise a measure of control over their lives. During the next two decades, Bandura (1986, 1997) advanced his social cognitive theory, in which people are viewed as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting, and self-regulating rather than as solely reactive organisms, products of environmental or concealed inner influences. From this agentic perspective, people are seen as contributors to their life circumstances, not just recipients of them. In this way, people are ``partial architects of their own destinies'' (Bandura, 1997, p. 8).},

Symptoms of teachers' stress and burnout (e.g., emotional exhaustion) are also thought to influence students' achievement, but no empirical study has tested this prediction. Using multilevel analyses and a representative sample consisting of 1,102 German elementary school teachers and their students, we addressed this gap in knowledge by examining the association between teachers' emotional exhaustion and students' achievement in mathematics, and by testing whether classroom composition moderates this relation. We controlled for teachers' gender, their years of experience, their teaching certificate, and the composition of the class, and on the student level for students' gender, language spoken at home, socioeconomic status, and cognitive ability. Results revealed that teachers' emotional exhaustion was significantly negatively related to students' mathematics achievement, even after teacher characteristics and classroom composition were controlled for. Classroom composition moderated this relation, whereby teachers' emotional exhaustion was more strongly related to students' achievement in classes with a high percentage of language minority students. These results highlight the importance of teachers' well-being for students' learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

The final part of the task was prepared to provide an experience of failure: due to a faulty USB-memory stick, completion of the task was not possible. Results suggest a stereotype threat effect on women's attribution of failure: in the negative threat condition, women attributed the failure more internally (to their own inability), and men more externally (to the faulty technical equipment).

A total of 3667 undergraduate students from Serbia participated in three studies. Cross-sectional data were used in Study 1 and Study 2, and longitudinal data were used in Study 3. The results supported the GSE's modified single-factor structure as well as strict measurement invariance across gender and time. The GSE demonstrated adequate internal consistency, moderate 4-month and 2-year test-retest reliability, and good convergent validity in relation to measures of positive expectations and subjective well-being. After controlling for the initial levels of well-being, the GSE showed limited predictive utility in predicting subjective well-being (positive affect, life satisfaction, emotional distress) over periods of 4~months and 2~years. Our findings suggest that use of the GSE for predictive purposes should be carefully examined in future studies.},

Afterward, the feasibility of theoretical synthesis is considered. Finally, some possible directions are proposed for theoretical integration among five contemporary theories of social and gender development: social cognitive theory, expectancy-value theory, cognitive-developmental theory, gender schema theory, and self-categorization theory.},

According to Bandura's self-efficacy, enhancing ICT self-efficacy, which might be affected by technology experience, could be a pathway to improving ICT literacy and competence, which should be one focus of medical educationalists. However, there is a lack of suitable measurements of medical students' self-efficacy and a clear understanding of its relationship with technology experience. We conducted a literature review and direct consultation with an expert panel to identify potential items for the ICT self-efficacy scale. Based on the data collected in a survey of 486 first-year medical students in China, the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to confirm the structure of the final version. Furthermore, we used linear regressions to quantify the association between ICT self-efficacy and technology experience measured by the age of first access to the Internet, the age at first ownership of a personal computer (PC) or a laptop, and that of a smartphone. The EFA results derived 15 items of four factors, with 67.02\% of the total variance explained: Privacy and Safety, Differencing, Communication, and Learning and Application. The Cronbach's alphas for the four subscales and the overall scale ranged from 0.78 to 0.89. Regression results demonstrated a significant association of ICT self-efficacy with age at first ownership of a personal computer (PC) and the mediation role of the general self-efficacy in the ICT self-efficacy's association with the age at first ownership of a personal smartphone. The ICT scale developed is a reliable and valid task-specific measure to assess ICT Self-Efficacy for medical students. In addition, enhancing students' technology experience might improve their ICT self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {Little academic and policy attention has addressed the `digital divide' among children and young people. This article analyses findings from a national survey of UK 9---19-year-olds that reveal inequalities by age, gender and socioeconomic status in relation to their quality of access to and use of the internet. Since both the extent of use and the reasons for low- and non-use of the internet vary by age, a different explanation for the digital divide is required for children compared with adults. Looking beyond the idea of a binary divide, we propose instead a continuum of digital inclusion. Gradations in frequency of internet use (from non and low users through to weekly and daily users) are found to map onto a progression in the take-up of online opportunities among young people (from basic through moderate to broad and then all-round users), thus beginning to explain why differences in internet use matter, contributing to inclusion and exclusion. Demographic, use and expertise variables are all shown to play a role in accounting for variations in the breadth and depth of internet use.},

It uniquely identifies the factors affecting the digital divide that have emerged in recent years (2017--2021) as well as investigate if there are new forms or levels of the divide that have surfaced in recent literature. The findings, based on 50 included studies, show that the factors affecting the digital divide can be classified into three different segments and nine main categories: sociodemographic, socioeconomic, personal elements, social support, type of technology, digital training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events. Out of all factors, education has been linked to the digital divide the most. The majority of recent literature have studied Level 2 of the divide. Also, only one article in the sample has considered the digital divide at the firm level. Findings also show that a new form, type-of-internet access, and two potential new levels of the digital divide, algorithmic awareness and data inequalities, have been identified in the contemporary literature. The results contribute to the understanding and development of the different perspectives of the digital divide concept. They also contribute to the stream of literature on the determinants of the divide and to the social inequalities and digital inclusion literature. This review can be seen as a guide for managers to realize and understand the forms that the divide can take and to delve into their organizational capabilities on the digitalization front and evaluate where further development is needed within their organizations to help diminish the divide.},

  abstract = {Many studies have been carried out on this concept of self efficacy in the academic settings. For example, Schunk (1995) stated that students when engaged in activities are affected by personal (e.g., goal setting, information processing) and situational influences (rewards, feedbacks). These provide students an idea on how well they learn. Self efficacy was enhanced when students perceived they performed well. On the other hand, Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara and Pastorelli (1996), reported that parents' academic aspirations for their children, influence the children's academic achievement directly or indirectly by influencing their self efficacy. Based on the theoretical explanation on self efficacy and findings of past studies, it is therefore the aim of this study to find out the relationship between students' self efficacy and their English language achievement. In Malaysia, English is a second language but since 2003, English is the medium of instruction for mathematics and science subjects for year one, form one and form six students. Based on this scenario, it is therefore pertinent to find out whether performance in the English language is largely determined by their perceived English language efficacy. A descriptive-correlational study was conducted on 1,146 students from eight secondary schools in the Petaling district, Selangor. The instruments used to measure self efficacy were the Self Efficacy Scale developed by Bandura (1995) and the Self Efficacy Scale developed by Kim and Park (1997). The findings showed that 51 percent of students had high self efficacy while 48 percent showed low self efficacy. Correlational analysis showed positive correlations between several dimensions of self efficacy that is, academic achievement eficacy (r = 0.48, p = 0.001); other expectancy beliefs (r = 0.34, p = 0.005); and self assertiveness (r = 0.41, p = 0.005) with academic performance in English language. In conclusion, achievement in English language will improve when students have high self efficacy in the language. The implications are discussed in relation to teaching and learning within the school settings. Abstrak: Beberapa kajian telah dijalankan dalam bidang akademik tentang konsep efikasi kendiri. Contohnya, Schunk (1995) menyatakan bahawa pelajar yang terlibat dalam aktiviti sering dipengaruhi oleh faktor peribadi (penentuan matlamat, pemprosesan maklumat) dan situasi (ganjaran, maklum balas). Perkara ini memberi idea kepada pelajar tentang sebaik mana mereka telah belajar. Efikasi kendiri akan meningkat apabila pelajar beranggapan mereka telah melakukan yang terbaik. Sebaliknya, Bandura, Babaranelli, Caprara dan Pastorelli (1996) melaporkan bahawa aspirasi akademik ibu bapa untuk anak-anak mempengaruhi secara langsung atau tidak langsung pencapaian akademik mereka melalui pengaruh ibu bapa ke atas efikasi kendiri anak-anak. Berdasarkan penerangan teori tentang efikasi kendiri dan dapatan kajian lepas, maka tujuan kajian ini adalah untuk melihat perhubungan antara efikasi kendiri pelajar dengan pencapaian 61 Rahil Mahyuddin et al. mereka dalam bahasa Inggeris. Di Malaysia, bahasa Inggeris merupakan bahasa kedua tetapi sejak 2003, bahasa Inggeris ialah bahasa pengantar bagi mata pelajaran matematik dan sains untuk murid tahun satu, tingkatan satu dan tingkatan enam rendah. Senario ini membuatkan kajian ini relevan untuk melihat sama ada prestasi dalam bahasa Inggeris ditentukan oleh persepsi pelajar tentang efikasi mereka dalam bahasa Inggeris. Reka bentuk kajian ini ialah deskriptif korelasi dan dijalankan ke atas 1,146 pelajar daripada lapan buah sekolah menengah di daerah Petaling, Selangor. Instrumen yang digunakan untuk mengukur efikasi kendiri ialah Skala Efikasi Kendiri oleh Bandura (1995), dan Kim dan Park (1997). Dapatan menunjukkan 51 peratus pelajar mempunyai efikasi kendiri yang tinggi manakala 48 peratus mempuyai efikasi kendiri yang rendah. Analisis korelasi menunjukkan perhubungan positif antara beberapa dimensi efikasi kendiri, iaitu efikasi pencapaian akdemik (r = 0.48, p = 0.001); kepercayaan jangkaan yang lain (r = 0.34, p = 0.005) dan ketegasan kendiri (r = 0.41, p = 0.005) dengan prestasi dalam bahasa Inggeris. Kesimpulannya, pencapaian dalam bahasa Inggeris akan meningkat sekiranya pelajar mempunyai efikasi kendiri yang tinggi dalam bahasa tersebut. Implikasinya dibincangkan dari segi pengajaran dan pembelajaran dalam bilik darjah.}

Our purpose is to ascertain their relative abilities to isolate the CSE construct from other related constructs and to capture variance in performance attributed to changes in CSE level. In addition, we investigate the importance of ensuring the measure being used is sufficiently aligned with the task domain of interest. Finally, we explore the stability of CSE measures as they relate to the current state of evolution within the computing domain. Marakas, Yi, and Johnson ( 1998) proposed a framework for the construction of instruments intended to measure the CSE construct that we have adopted as a basis for this series of investigations. To that end, we advance and test a set of hypotheses derived from the Marakas et al. ( 1998) framework. Results of the analyses support the need for adherence to the tenets of the proposed framework as well as provide evidence that CSE measures suffer from degradation of their explanatory power over time. Further, this study brings forth the importance of appropriately validating measures of CSE using approaches intended for a formative rather than a reflective construct. These results suggest that the common practices of instrument validation and reuse of long-standing instruments to measure CSE may not be the most effective approach to the study of the construct. Implications for future research are discussed.}

We suggest that such results may be attributable to a general lack of attention to the dynamic, multileveled, and multifaceted nature of the computer self-efficacy construct. We offer examples from the extant CSE literature suggesting weaknesses in existing measures of the construct as well as issues associated with manipulations and the need for control of antecedent and consequent factors directly associated with CSE. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to provide a thorough review of the extant literature related to CSE; (2) to present an integrated model of empirical findings, constructed from a wide variety of disciplines, that comprehensively defines the multifaceted nature of task-specific CSE in terms of its antecedent, consequent, and moderating factors; (3) to present a conceptual model of CSE at the general versus task-specific level; and (4) to use the two models of CSE to proffer guidelines for both measurement and manipulation of the construct. Through our review of the CSE literature, we offer several thoughts regarding the nature of the empirical results obtained to date. The combined objectives serve as a basis for establishing a foundation upon which future research investigating the CSE construct can be based.},

Not surprisingly, male participants showed significantly higher interest and social adjustment to technology. Only in the social context for male and female in-service teachers did no gender difference appeared.

First, we examine how cultural stereotypes specific to STEM contribute to gender gaps by negatively impacting interest and academic outcomes. Second, we review the central role of the self-representations affected by those stereotypes, including the particular importance of a sense of belonging in STEM. Third, we discuss various interventions that buffer against stereotypes and enhance a sense of belonging to improve interest and academic outcomes. We find that STEM gender gaps in interest and academic outcomes are malleable and can be changed through interventions. Finally, we suggest directions for future research. By organizing the research in this way, our review and theoretical analysis clarifies key factors contributing to the current gender gaps in STEM and mechanisms by which psychological interventions can help address and reduce STEM gender gaps.},

(in press). Because it's boring, irrelevant and I don't like computers': Why high school girls avoid professionally-oriented ICT subjects. Computers \& Education.]. Policy makers as well as researchers often assume that the interest of girls in computing and ICT-professions could be increased at school. For example, female teachers who are confident ICT-users, are expected to act as positive role models for girls. However, because most of the research on gender and computing has been focussing on the influence of none-school related factors, there is little empirical evidence that schools or teachers are able to influence girls' attitude toward ICT. Using the data of a Dutch large-scale survey on ICT use in primary education (almost 4000 grade 5 students), this study explores the influence of both none-school related factors and school related factors on students' computer attitude. Although the between-school variance of girls' computer attitude is higher than that of boys' computer attitude, multilevel analyses show that most of the variance in computer attitude is explained by none-school related student factors. Two school related factors turned out to have a small positive effect on the computer attitude of girls: a teacher-centred pedagogical approach and the computer experience of female teachers.},

- More boys than girls have gender stereotyped views of computers. The majority of boys in grade 5 are convinced that boys know more about computers than girls do; about a third of the girls agrees with them. Girls with less gender-stereotyped views on computers were expected to have more positive computer attitudes. --{$>$} Really important!\\
- ecause girls show lower intensity and lower self-efficacy in computer use than boys, these reciprocal relations may increase gender differences in computer attitudes in the long term. In other words, gender differences in computer attitude may increase with age.\\
- However, if the teacher is female, the computer experience of the teacher has a small effect on girls' computer attitude (.07, Table 4). This significant interaction effect accords with the `role model theory'. This theory assumes that female teachers who are confident in using ICT can enhance the attractiveness of computers for girls (e.g. Brosnan, 1998). \\
- In other words, although female teachers show the same intensity and the same variety in ICT use for educational purposes, they are less convinced about their ICT knowledge and skills than their male colleagues are.\\

However, despite the numerous studies on this subject, consensus about explanations for these gender differences in computer attitudes is still lacking. Three main theories will be discussed: socialisation, gender specific behaviour and the influence of teaching. Compared to computer attitude studies, the availability of studies and theories on students' computer competencies is much more limited. Students' own assessment of their abilities in general computer use has received more attention in this field of research, although this subject is also often addressed from a gender perspective.},

Secondly, to understand the variation of digital diffusion and digital literacy across areas (with different levels of poverty), age groups, genders and occupations. The data is collected from surveys focused on measuring the access to information, digital diffusion and the use of technology among the poor. This study found that there is a digital divide problem among people in urban areas, especially among people with low incomes. Moreover, the diffusion is dominated by certain groups such as younger people and females. Furthermore, digital literacy among the poor is low. The policy implication is to improve access for digital diffusion and provide assistance to improve digital literacy skills.},

  abstract = {This small-scale study focuses on young children's reported information and communication technology (ICT) experiences in the home and the role of parents in providing technological opportunities, recognition and support. The children of the parents involved were all enrolled in nursery and reception classes (4---5 years of age) in two settings (referred to hereafter as Stafford School and Hill School). The term home is used here to denote any context in children's lives beyond the school/nursery environs whilst the interpretation of ICT is equally broad and inclusive in nature and encompasses any technology associated with the handling and electronic transmission of information and/or its use in controlling the operations of machines and other devices (HMI, 1989). In this context therefore ICT would include such things as telephones, televisions, video, audio recorders, CD and DVD players, CD-ROMs, programmable toys, games consoles, radios and, of course, computers. The study found that differences in the incidence and availability of ICT in the children's homes could be subtle on occasion and were the result of a number of factors. Children might have `access' to certain technologies in that they were present in their home environments but this did not necessarily mean that children were always able and/or allowed to `use' those technologies. It supports the arguments made by Marsh and others elsewhere (Marsh, 2004; Marsh et al., 2005) that young children are already in possession of ICT knowledge and competences when they arrive in nursery and reception classes partly as a result of varying levels of parental intervention and modelling as well as being in the process of acquiring new knowledge, skills and attitudes. The study also argues that parents' involvement with ICT was often characterized by conscious but sometimes uncertain efforts to limit opportunities and access to ICT in the perceived best interests of the children (Clarke, 2006).},

However, to achieve this goal, universities need to accurately identify and focus their efforts on students most likely to quit their studies before they graduate. This has given rise to a need to implement forecasting models to predict which students will eventually drop out. In this paper, we present an early warning system to automatically identify first-semester students at high risk of dropping out. The system is based on a machine learning model trained from historical data on first-semester students. The results show that the system can predict ``at-risk'' students with a sensitivity of 61.97\%, which allows early intervention for those students, thereby reducing the student attrition rate.},

Multi-stage sampling techniques that include stratified and purposive sampling were adopted. The sampling size was set at 394, but 366 returned questionnaires were found useful for analysis. The result of findings on the level of computer self-efficacy among undergraduate students at the University of Ilorin indicated that students are highly versed in using computers as a tool, sorting out information from search results, knowing how to access information databases and information repositories, and easily finding the information they need with their computer skills. On students' information-seeking behavior, most users agreed that they consult the library when seeking information that could assist them in their course of study and academic program, and they are willing to pay for relevant information and always check for currency and relevance of the information sources they're using. There is a strong and significant positive relationship between computer self-efficacy and informationseeking behavior. There is no significant relationship between demographic variables and computer self-efficacy. Likewise, there was no significant relationship between demographic variables and information-seeking behavior.},

This chapter discusses that the belief that children create, develop, and hold to be true about themselves are vital forces in their success or failure in all endeavors, and of particular relevance to educators for their success or failure in school. The assumption that children's self-beliefs are inextricably tied to their thinking and functioning, seems so sound, so obvious, and so commonsensical. One might well think that research on academic motivation and achievement should naturally focus, at least in great part, on the things that children come to believe about themselves. The chapter's focus on a child's sense of ``self'' seems so reasonable that one would think it has always been instrumental in framing the discussion around educational concerns. The chapter explains the historical view that explains that understanding critical issues related to children's sense of self is crucial to understanding the manner in which they deal with all of life's tasks and challenges. Researchers generally agree that children develop a self-concept primarily through their interpretations of the reflected appraisals of others. The chapter concludes by reviewing psychological concepts that are responsible for the current resurgence of interest in self-beliefs in recent years, and by providing a discussion of some of the major educational implications that result from this renewed focus on students' self-beliefs in school.}

  abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) use in teaching is a significant concern in educational systems worldwide. Teachers' psychological factors, such as their self-efficacy and attitudes toward ICT use, have been considered influential in implementing ICT in teaching. However, previous studies have focused on small sample sizes or a limited number of countries and have largely ignored the mediation effect of attitudes on the relationship between self-efficacy and ICT use. This study addresses these limitations by using data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) to examine the relationship between these factors. Specifically, the study synthesizes evidence on the mediation effect of attitudes on the relation of self-efficacy and ICT use in teaching, controlling for ICT resources at school and teachers' backgrounds. In addition, the study examines the variation in this relationship across varied educational settings. The findings suggest that attitude significantly and partially mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and ICT use in teaching, with variations across different countries. The country's ICT infrastructure partly explains this cross-country variability in the mediation relationship. This large-scale data research reveals the mediation effect of attitudes mediate their self-efficacy and ICT use in teaching. This relationship varies across ICILS countries and is influenced to some extent by the country's ICT infrastructure, which informs global educational policies to improve ICT implementation.},

This study used the ICILS data to explore whether the achievement test used in this study addressed specific dimensions of CIL and, if so, whether the performances of girls and boys on these subscales differ. We investigated the hypothesis that gender differences in performance on computer literacy items would be slightly in favour of boys, whereas gender differences in performance on information literacy items would be slightly in favour of girls. Furthermore, it was examined whether such differences varied across European countries and if item bias was present. Data was analysed using a confirmative factor analysis model, i.e. a multidimensional item response theory model, for the identification of the subscales, the explorations of gender and national differences, and possible item bias. To a large extent the results support our postulated hypothesis and shed new light on the commonly assumed disadvantaged position of girls and women in modern information society.},

This systematic review aims to examine the gender differences in ICT use and skills for learning through technology. A comprehensive search of eight journal databases and a specific selection criterion was carried out to exclude articles that match our stated exclusion criteria. We included 42 peer-reviewed empirical publications and conference proceedings published between 2006 and 2020. For a subsample of studies, we performed a small-scale meta-analysis to quantify possible gender differences in ICT use and skills. A random-effects model uncovered a small and positive, yet not significant, effect size in favor of boys (g~=\,0.17, 95\% CI [-0.01, 0.36]). However, this finding needs to be further backed by large-scale meta-analyses, including more study samples and a broader set of ICT use and skills measures. We highlight several concerns that should be addressed and more thoroughly in collaboration with one another to better IT skills and inspire new policies to increase the quality of ICT use. The findings from this review further suggest implications and present existing research challenges and point to future research directions.},

Hence, this study addressed the following questions: (a) Are newcomers in the classroom more likely to become victims? (b) Does a stable classroom, where children generally have the same classmates over time, lead to less change in bully nominations? To address these questions, this article examined 3 waves of bully nominations in a sample of 3,254 children (50\% boys; age 8--12) in 31 elementary schools, displaying three types of schools: stable or unstable administrative or pedagogical multigrade. Both research questions were answered by longitudinal social network analyses of the school-wide networks. The meta-analyzed results of these analyses with small effect sizes showed that (a) although stable classrooms do not necessarily show less change in bully nominations than in unstable classrooms, victim-bully ties are more likely to develop among students in the same grade or same classroom and (b) newcomers were more likely to become victims, more so in unstable schools than in stable schools.

However, we found no statistical evidence for the prediction that the compositional effect should be mediated by the instructional climate in the classroom. Cross-level interaction analyses revealed that only language minority students were increasingly motivated in classrooms with a higher proportion of language minority students.

Our findings point to a potential mechanism that links ICT use, self-efficacy, and CIL. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.},

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being.

For this purpose, their positive, negative, and neutral perceptions of the associated characteristics of these workers were also analyzed. Likewise, the use of masculine, feminine, or neutral expressions to describe these professionals was explored. The existence of gender differences in these aspects was also investigated. 900 students from Catalonia (51~\% girls) enrolled in the last course of junior secondary education (mean of age=15~years old; S.D.\,=\,1.73) participated in a survey with close and open-ended questions. Content analysis of responses to an open-ended question indicated that the boys and girls held several stereotypical beliefs about ICT professionals (a highly male-dominated field), but they also reported counter-stereotypical beliefs about them. As expected, these stereotypical beliefs described a masculine portrayal of ICT workers. Contrary to expectations, most of the students' portrayals of people working in ICT were either positive or neutral, not negative. Likewise and opposite to predictions, young males did not show more positive attitudes towards ICT professionals than girls. In fact, both girls and boys evaluated more positively than negatively the different descriptive aspects associated with ICT professionals. In support of expectations, most boys and girls referred to masculine role models working in ICT. No gender differences were observed in the type of characteristics associated with ICT professionals. However, young females were more likely to offer feminine references about professions where ICT is the tool rather than the object of their work. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings within the context of Spain are discussed.},

Moreover, terms are often not theoretically grounded. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of digital divide determinants. The results show that the third-level digital divide was underexposed. The primary focus is on Internet use. More importantly, the identified determinants show that digital divide research is largely limited to sociodemographic and socioeconomic determinants.},

This correlation varied between studies and was moderated by the type of SES measure, the type of ICT literacy assessment, the broad categories of ICT skills assessed, the assessment of test fairness, and the sampling procedure employed. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that students' ICT literacy differs between socioeconomic status groups, thus pointing to a gap in the domain of ICT.

Carefully designed studies and measures for which a validity argument has been crafted are needed when studying achievement gaps in the domain of ICT in future studies.},

Analyzing the data from 1208 Norwegian secondary school teachers who participated in the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 by means of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, we found that: (a) CSE can be described by three factors (self-efficacy in basic operational skills, advanced operational and collaborative skills, and in using computers for instructional purposes) which remain invariant across gender; (b) male teachers had higher CSE in basic (d=-1.03) and advanced operational skills (d=-0.49); (c) no significant gender differences for CSE in using computers for instructional purposes existed; (d) teachers' CSE was differentially related to their participation in professional development courses for females and males. The differentiation into three factors of CSE provides a more detailed view on teachers' CSE than unidimensional approaches.

In order to explore profiles of ICT use in schools and at home for different purposes such as recreation, study purposes, exchanging information, and social communication, we take a person-centered approach and apply latent profile analysis. These analyses revealed two independent user profiles and showed that background characteristics (i.e., gender, immigration status) and motivational constructs (i.e., self-efficacy, interest, and enjoyment in ICT) play a significant role in determining profile membership. Significant differences between the user profiles in students' computer and information literacy test performance did not exist. Given that the coverage of ICT at home and in schools has increased substantially over the last decades, the identification of user profiles informs teachers and parents about whether or not students exploit these opportunities to the same extent. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

Moreover, most of these studies, predominantly based on the construct of parental mediation, use self-assessments which are not considered valid indicators of actual ICT literacy. By investigating different aspects of a digital home learning environment, we extended prior research by (a) using an objective test of ICT literacy to examine this question. In addition, (b) we included children's ICT self-efficacy as a second outcome variable, which is an important motivational variable for self-directed and lifelong learning, and (c) to gain a comprehensive understanding of ICT-related parental beliefs and practices, both adolescent and parent perspectives were considered and examined for their predictive power. Using data from 422 children (aged between 11 and 14 years) and their parents, adolescent and parent reports showed medium correlations. The results show that parental ICT values (beliefs about the importance of being able to work with ICT) positively predict ICT literacy while monitoring/supervision (e.g., controlling children's online activities) negatively predicts ICT literacy. According to predictive power, after controlling for gender and students' educational level, adolescent reports predicted ICT self-efficacy (27\%) better than parent reports (9\%), while the opposite was found for ICT literacy (adolescents: 8\%; parents: 18\%).},

The effect of female VTE teachers in enrollment in these diplomas reaches 4.0 percentage points, equivalent to an 18\% reduction in the observed gender gap. We argue that female VTE teachers, acting as role models, have the potential to mitigate the traditional barriers that young women encounter to persist in the STEM pipeline, thereby contributing to closing the STEM gender gap.},

Whereas these differences have largely been examined in traditional domains, such as mathematics, reading, and science, the existing body of empirical studies in the domain of ICT literacy is considerably smaller, yet abounds in diverse findings. One of the persistent findings however is that boys consider their ICT literacy to be higher than that of girls. This meta-analysis tests whether the same pattern holds for students' actual performance on ICT literacy tasks, as measured by performance-based assessments. In total, 46 effect sizes were extracted from 23 empirical studies using a random-effects model. Overall, the gender differences in ICT literacy were significant, positive, and favored girls (g~=~+~0.12, 95 \% CI = [0.08, 0.16]). This effect varied between studies, and moderation analyses indicated that the grade level students were taught at moderated its magnitude---effect sizes were larger in primary school as compared to secondary school. In conclusion, our findings contrast those obtained from previous meta-analyses that were based on self-reported ICT literacy and suggest that the ICT gender gap may not be as severe as it had been claimed to be.},

This paper presents a systematic review of research where these concepts are used in higher education research. The aim is to establish an understanding of referencing strategy to digital literacy and digital competence over time, disciplines, countries, methods and level of analysis. Three databases were used in the systematic literature review: Web of Science, Scopus and Education Resources Information Centre. We delimited the search to title, abstract and keywords in the databases. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed publications written in English. Initially 107 publications between 1997 and 2017 were found, with 28 addressing digital competence and 79 digital literacy. Our review demonstrates that there is a range of definitions used in higher education research. They vary depending on if the concepts are defined by policy, research or both and whether they focus on technical skills or social practices. This review indicates directions for further research in higher education i) do more research based on critical perspectives to avoid commonsensical use of the concepts, ii) take the development of definitions of these concepts seriously iii) avoid cross-referencing incompatibilities and finally iv) engage in critical investigations regarding the legitimacy of policy over research in the domain of higher education research.},

  abstract = {The current study is a first step in investigating how virtual organizations can manage remote employees effectively. The research used self-efficacy theory to build a model that predicts relationships between antecedents to employees' remote work self-efficacy assessments and their behavioral and attitudinal consequences. The model was tested using responses from 376 remotely-managed employees in 18 diverse organizations. Overall, the results indicated that remote employees' self-efficacy assessments play a critical role in influencing their remote work effectiveness, perceived productivity, job satisfaction and ability to cope. Furthermore, strong relationships were observed between employees' remote work self-efficacy judgments and several antecedents, including remote work experience and training, best practices modeling by management, computer anxiety, and IT capabilities. Because many of these antecedents can be controlled managerially, these findings suggest important ways in which a remote employee's work performance can be enhanced, through the intermediary effect of improved remote work self-efficacy. The current study also provides a basis for future research in the remote work area through its development and testing of a remote management framework.}

Reflecting the pressure of this vulnerability, Blacks underperformed in relation to Whites in the ability-diagnostic condition but not in the nondiagnostic condition (with Scholastic Aptitude Tests controlled). Study 3 validated that ability-diagnosticity cognitively activated the racial stereotype in these participants and motivated them not to conform to it, or to be judged by it. Study 4 showed that mere salience of the stereotype could impair Blacks' performance even when the test was not ability diagnostic. The role of stereotype vulnerability in the standardized test performance of ability-stigmatized groups is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Despite the ubiquity of ICT and higher education's integration of these technologies, studies show incoming students often fall short in their ICT skills. The purpose of this study is to extend prior research to explore the ICT exposure, use, and access factors that influence students' ICT self-efficacy, and to identify any gender- or income-based group differences. Using a two-year sample of incoming first-year students at a public research university in the United States, the study shows significant relationships between ICT access, prior academic exposure, and Internet use on perceptions of ICT skills. The study also finds students are confident in many ICT skills, though student self-efficacy in their content creation skills was limited. While parental income was not found to be a significant factor, some gender differences in ICT self-efficacy continue to exist. The findings, along with movement in higher education towards distributed and electronic learning, suggest that it is important for universities to emphasize and integrate digital content creation into courses and curricula.},

We tested the hypothesis that middle school students strongly associate technology with men and caregiving with women in a Swedish context (i.e., a country that scores high in gender equality indices), and that these gender stereotypes for tech relate to girls' lower interest in tech-focused education. We measured technology/caregiving gender stereotypes with implicit (the Implicit Association Test) and explicit (self-report) measures in a sample of middle school students (n\,=\,873). The results supported the main hypotheses, and corroborate Eccles's expectancy value theory, indicating that the endorsement of implicit gender stereotypes may serve as barriers to pursuing masculine-typed career paths for women. Further, a sample of middle school teachers (n\,=\,86) showed stronger implicit gender stereotypes than the students. Unexpectedly, middle school girls with a foreign background showed no implicit gender stereotypes, which we discuss in relation to the gender-equality paradox. These findings suggest that to fulfill the recruitment needs of an increasingly digitalized world, the tech-industry and other stakeholders should put effort into counteracting the stereotype that technology is for men.},

Since women have weaker ability beliefs and interest in technology than men, it is especially important to learn how science center visits affect them. In this study, we tested if programming exercises offered to middle school students by a Swedish science center would increase ability beliefs and interest in programming. Students in grades 8 and 9 (n\,=\,506) completed a survey before and after visiting the science center, and their ratings were compared to a wait-list control group (n\,=\,169). The students participated in block-based, text-based, and robot programming exercises developed by the science center. The results showed that programming ability beliefs increased for women, but not men, and that interest in programming decreased for men, but not women. The effects persisted at a follow-up (2--3~months). The young men reported stronger ability beliefs and interest than the young women at all timepoints. The results imply that science center activities can make programming feel less hard, but adaptations may be needed to also increase interest.},

We use four cohorts of 5th grade student's assessment of Math and Portuguese in Brazilian elementary public schools and apply an identification strategy relying on school level gender peer effects and school fixed effects to control for self-selection of students across schools. We identify a positive relationship between scholastic achievement and the proportion of female students. This effect is underlined by improvements in student behavior, as indicated by teachers' assessment of student's academic potential, self-esteem, interest, discipline, absenteeism, and perception about syllabus coverage and school violence. Hence, this research draws attention to gender as an important factor in the allocation of students and teachers within schools. The consideration of our findings in the formulation and execution of policies can result in effective low-cost measures aimed at increasing achievement.}

ICT user profiles were developed as an empirical framework to identify and categorize students based on how frequent they use ICT. In this paper, we have chosen six ICT user profiles in order to distinguish between leisure activities and school activities. Each ICT user-profile was computed by combining two dimensions (frequency of ICT use for leisure purposes and frequency of ICT use for school purposes). We tried to identify how students' perception of their ability to solve a task is related to both their gender and how frequently they use ICT. The results showed that student's self-efficacy varied between the ICT user profiles. The findings showed how an increased level of self-efficacy in ICT High-level tasks is related to both an increased level of leisure use and with an increased level of educational use. Further, our findings provided evidence in support of positive relationships (for both males and the females) between Self-efficacy in ICT and the ICT user profiles.},

A total of 1080 eighth graders were randomly selected from all junior high school students in Taiwan. The Internet Self-Efficacy Scale (ISES) was developed and used to examine students' Internet self-efficacy in two dimensions: online exploration (explorative ISE) and online communication (communicative ISE). A survey including the ISES instrument was administered to all the subjects and finally 936 valid questionnaires (from 466 males and 470 females) were returned for data analyses. No significant gender difference was found in students' total ISE and explorative ISE; however, a significant gender difference was found in students' communicative ISE. Surprisingly, the girls had significant higher communicative ISE than had the boys. In addition, there was no significant gender difference in students' Internet using experience and computer ownerships; however, there were significant gender differences in their Internet using purpose and intensity. In spite of the boys showed a significantly higher Internet use intensity than did the girls, the boys were more exploration-oriented Internet users and the girls were more communication-oriented Internet users. And this orientation played a significant role in their Internet self-efficacy. These results suggested that the gender gap may no longer exist in young students' confidence in using the Internet. However, boys and girls used the Internet for significantly different purposes suggesting that the Internet played different roles for boys and girls in Taiwan. With a large scale examination by using a valid and reliable instrument, this study provided representative results for further related studies.},

Much of the work on the social psychology of intergroup relations has focused on patterns of individual prejudices and discrimination and on the motivational sequences of interpersonal interaction. The intensity of explicit intergroup conflicts of interests is closely related in human cultures to the degree of opprobrium attached to the notion of "renegade" or "traitor." The basic and highly reliable finding is that the trivial, ad hoc intergroup categorization leads to in-group favoritism and discrimination against the out-group. Many orthodox definitions of "social groups" are unduly restrictive when applied to the context of intergroup relations. The equation of social competition and intergroup conflict rests on the assumptions concerning an "ideal type" of social stratification in which the salient dimensions of intergroup differentiation are those involving scarce resources.},

Agent-based decision support systems (DSS) can assist employees in information processing tasks and decrease processing requirements.

In the present study, we distinguish degrees of DSS autonomy, operationalized by levels of automation (LOA), the delegation of task processing stages, and user control. In two vignette studies, we investigate the effects of DSS autonomy on perceptions of information load reduction, technostress, and user intention as well as the moderating role of technology and job experience. With high DSS autonomy, participants reported higher levels of information load reduction and technostress as well as lower levels of user intention. Job experience was a significant moderator. For high autonomy DSS, participants in the high job experience condition indicated greater information load reducation, lower technostress, and higher user intentions. Results suggest, that while being beneficial for decreasing information load, high DSS autonomy may negatively impact technostress and user intentions. It is suggested that technology and job training may improve user reactions.},

Despite longstanding research on human-technology interaction and diverse theoretical approaches describing competences for interacting with digital systems, research still offers mixed results regarding the structure of digital competences. Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. The present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (DSE) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. Further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the DigComp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. The factorial structure of the DSE scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. Further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ICT use, technophobia). Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

The participants of the study were 301 (135 male and 166 female) students who responded to a self-report questionnaire. Regression analysis showed that perceived teacher expectations were positively associated with students' ability beliefs, perceptions of learning activities as creative and personally meaningful was a significant predictor of students' interest in computing, and perceived parental support was related to both value and efficacy beliefs. Unlike previous research, the findings of this study did not support the conclusion that boys have more positive ICT self-efficacy and value beliefs than girls. They indicated however, that boys' and girls' beliefs are differentially affected by parents, teachers, and school IS instruction.},

  abstract = {In this study, we examined relations between outside school computer experiences, perceived social support for using computers, and self-efficacy and value beliefs about computer learning for 340 Greek elementary school boys and girls. Participants responded to a questionnaire about their access to computer use outside school (e.g. frequency of use and nature of activities), perceived parental and peer support, and computer self-efficacy and value beliefs. Although almost all students used computers outside school, there were significant gender differences in frequency and type of computer use. Also, boys reported more perceived support from their parents and peers to use computers and more positive computer self-efficacy and value beliefs than girls. Parental support and, to a lesser extent, peer support were the factors more strongly associated with boys' and girls' computer self-efficacy and value beliefs, while home computer access was not related to students' motivation. Our findings highlight the role of socialization in the gender gap in computing and the need for research and educational interventions that focus on the social practices that communicate gendered expectations to young boys and girls.},
  keywords = {Elementary education,Gender studies},
  annotation = {We hypothesized that, if gender differences do exist, they are not inevitable or ``natural'' but rather the result of different socialization experiences of boys and girls and a reflection of gendered social expectations expressed by family and peers. In our study, we hypothesized that these differences in girls' and boys' computer value and self-efficacy beliefs are related to the social support they receive for using computer activities and to the quality of computer experiences outside the school context.\\
\\
{\textquestiondown}Why is important self-efficacy ICT? "Research on achievement motivation has established the role of self-efficacy and task-value beliefs in students' academic choices, learning, and school performance (Bandura, 1993, Eccles and Wigfield, 1995). Self-efficacy beliefs are students' cognitive evaluations of their ability to successfully perform tasks of a particular domain (Bandura, 1993), and task-value beliefs concern students' reason for engaging in those tasks: their beliefs about the enjoyment they will get from the task (intrinsic value), the importance (attainment value) and the usefulness of the task (utility value) (Eccles \& Wigfield, 1995). Students are more likely to pursue academic activities that they consider valuable (Dickh{\"a}user \& Stiensmeier-Pelster, 2003) and within their range of perceived competence (Bandura, 1993). More importantly, both self-efficacy and task-value beliefs are significant predictors of students' future academic and career trajectories. Students with positive self-efficacy tend to engage thoughtfully (Pintrich \& DeGroot, 1990) and, as a result, to succeed in current learning activities and, therefore, prepare themselves better for future academic pursuits and are able to consider more career options (Bandura et al., 2001). Similarly, female and male students pursue academic studies and careers based on their value beliefs regarding the subject matter (Dickh{\"a}user and Stiensmeier-Pelster, 2003, Jacobs et al., 1998)."\\
\\
Family and friend support encourage the motivation and self-efficacy of technologies: "we found significant positive correlations between students' motivational beliefs and their social support and experiences. Students who thought that their parents encouraged them to use computers or whose friends supported their efforts to learn and shared their interest in computers were also more confident about their computer abilities, had more positive views about the value of computer learning, and tended to engage in a variety of computer activities. Students who had positive self-efficacy beliefs were also likely to think that computer learning was valuable to them. Finally, students who had positive self-efficacy and value beliefs were also likely to use computers for a large variety of tasks. In general, the patterns in these relationships were similar for boys and girls."\\
\\
When we used self-efficacy as the dependent variable, SES was marginally related to boys' self-efficacy only (see Table 6). Specifically, low SES was negatively related to boys' self-efficacy beliefs. When we entered student's computer experiences, the effects of SES diminished and only frequency of use and activity variety were significant. However, when the social support variables were added to the model, the effects of the computer experience variables decreased and parental support was the variable more strongly associated with self-efficacy for both boys and girls. Peer support was significant for boys and girls, frequency of computer use was marginally associated with girls' self-efficacy and activity variety was significant for both boys and girls. Interestingly, home computer access did not emerge as a significant variable for either boys or girls.\\
\\
We can add SES of parents to see if it is more important the support on men than in women:  Parental support emerged as the most important factor for both boys and girls. This suggests that the encouragement and expectations that parents express to their children are more important predictors of children's self-efficacy and value beliefs than children's own computer activities.\\
\\
"The hypothesis that females develop positive computer beliefs when they begin to use computers but gradually lose their confidence and interest in computers because they are not sufficiently supported by their social environment may explain why very few female students end up choosing to study information technology when they finish secondary school or even drop out from computer science courses (Margolis \& Fisher, 2003)"}

  abstract = {Background: On the basis of previous research, it was expected that perceived self-efficacy and social comparison would contribute to pursued goals and that these goals would influence course grades. It was further expected that a task orientation would contribute to perceived self-efficacy, and that an ego orientation would contribute to social comparison. Aims: The central question in the present study is whether the relationships between the above-mentioned motivational variables are as strongly developed in a particular area amongst beginners as they are amongst more advanced students. In view of the fact that beginners' knowledge concerning task requirements is restricted, we predicted that whilst relationships between these variables would be weak or absent in the case of beginners, they would be relatively strong amongst more advanced students. Samples: The sample consisted of 150 students from a secondary school. Methods: The participants answered questions about goal orientations, appraisals of self-efficacy, social comparison and about their personal goals. Course grades were used as a measure of study results. Results and conclusion: It was found that amongst the beginners and the advanced students perceived self-efficacy contributed to pursued goals and these goals in turn contributed to course grades. The relations between these variables were clearly less strong for the beginners than for the advanced students. Furthermore, it was ascertained that a task orientation contributed only to perceived self-efficacy amongst the advanced students, suggesting that for these students motivational variables were operative whereas they were still undeveloped amongst the beginners.},

Using a Delphi method approach, we develop the technical proficiency construct to uncover what competencies indicate technically proficiency, what business needs such proficiencies address, and how technical proficiency can be assessed. We uncover 16 qualities of technical proficiency, 14 common technology business needs, and 13 methods to assess proficiency. This research lays the groundwork for future research regarding IS Success and technical proficiency. Practitioners can use these findings to help better prepare their workforce for IS deployment.},

Although frequently assessed, available measures of CSE have various issues. Additionally, there is no current measure that delineates CSE at different skill levels and specifically targets usage in applied fields. Consequently, this set of seven studies describes the development and psychometric properties of two CSE scales that address these issues: the 18-item Brief Inventory of Technology Self-Efficacy (BITS) and the six-item Brief Inventory of Technology Self-Efficacy -- Short Form (BITS-SF). The first study encompassed conceptualization and item development. The second and third studies explored and confirmed the three-factor structure of the BITS (Novice, Advanced, and Expert) in samples of Mechanical Turk workers and college students, respectively. The fourth study examined the multigroup invariance of this factor structure across men and women. The fifth study showed evidence for the temporal stability of the BITS. The sixth study assessed for validity evidence for both scales. Finally, the seventh study used latent class analysis to determine the underlying classes of the BITS-SF. The uses of the BITS and BITS-SF are discussed. Both measures are available at www.bitssurvey.com.},

  abstract = {Self-efficacy is central to health behaviour theories due to its robust predictive capabilities. In this paper we present and review evidence for a self-efficacy-as-motivation argument in which standard self-efficacy questionnaires---i.e., ratings of whether participants ``can do'' the target behaviour---reflect motivation rather than perceived capability. The potential implication is that associations between self-efficacy ratings (particularly those that employ a ``can do'' operationalization) and health-related behaviours simply indicate that people are likely to do what they are motivated to do. There is some empirical evidence for the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument, with three studies demonstrating causal effects of outcome expectancy on subsequent self-efficacy ratings. Three additional studies show that---consistent with the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument---controlling for motivation by adding the phrase ``if you wanted to'' to the end of self-efficacy items decreases associations between self-efficacy ratings and motivation. Likewise, a qualitative study using a thought-listing procedure demonstrates that self-efficacy ratings have motivational antecedents. The available evidence suggests that the self-efficacy-as-motivation argument is viable, although more research is needed. Meanwhile, we recommend that researchers look beyond self-efficacy to identify the many and diverse sources of motivation for health-related behaviours.},

The present paper examines whether women's mathematics performance is differentially affected by the concern of confirming that a negative stereotype is true of the self (self-threat), than by the concern of confirming that the stereotype is true of their gender (group-threat). In two studies we independently manipulated these different threats for women taking a mathematics test. Gender identification moderated the effect of group-threats on test performance; only women highly identified with their gender underperformed. The performance of less gender-identified women was unaffected by group-threats. In contrast, gender identification did not moderate the effect of self-threats---both high- and low-identified women underperformed. The results of these studies suggest that women's math performance is differentially affected by the source of the threat.},

Using the 2020 Digital Divide Survey in Korea, our sample consists of 6520 native South Koreans and 699 North Korean migrants aged 18 years and older. We examined the three-way interaction of technological self-efficacy and being North Korean migrants in the relationship between the increase in the use of five types of digital technology, technological self-efficacy, and subjective well-being, using hierarchical linear regressions. North Korean migrants were statistically lower than South Korean natives in all types of increased digital technology use. Moderation analysis showed that technological self-efficacy positively moderated the relationship between increased digital technology use and subjective well-being. A three-way interaction showed that this relationship was stronger in North Korean migrants for three types of utilization, networking, information sharing, and life services. A psychosocial approach needs to be taken to digital technology education for North Korean migrants, in light of the potential benefits of technological self-efficacy.},

Educational expenditure on secondary education is positively related to digital skills in 2006, but not in 2003. At the school-level, whether the school is~public or private does not elicit impact on adolescents' self-reported digital skills; school ICT access is positively related to students' self-reported digital skills. At the individual-level, self-reported digital skills is affected by home ICT access, adolescents' Socio-Economic Status, gender and their history of using ICTs. The cross-level interaction effect of ICT penetration rate and home ICT access on self-reported digital skills is significant in the 2003 model, but not significant in the 2006 model. The cross-level interaction effect of ICT penetration rate and school ICT access is significant in the 2006 model.
