More specifically, the relationship between student, teacher and school level characteristics and primary school students' ICT competences is described in the context of direct, performance-based assessment. At the end of the chapter, three underlying topics that are important for future research are discussed, that is, 1) the difference between the theoretical and empirical dimensionality of ICT competences; 2) the development of user-friendly assessment instruments; and 3) the need for research focusing on alternative ICT competences.},

  abstract = {A growing body of research has examined the relations of dispositions toward information and communication technology (ICT) to science achievement among adolescent students. However, there is little research exploring the associations between ICT-related dispositions and science-related dispositions among adolescent students. Therefore, this study, employing a self-determination theory perspective, investigated the relationships of perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived autonomy related to ICT usage with dispositions toward science---enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science---among 258,192 adolescent students from 10,767 schools in 42 PISA 2015 participating countries. Results of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, indicated that students' perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived autonomy related to ICT usage were significantly positively related to their enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science. Further, the results of the study revealed that students' perceived autonomy related to ICT usage was more strongly associated with their dispositions toward science than perceived competence in ICT usage. Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {The digital divide limits the flow of potential students through the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline and into STEM careers. The digital divide is a dynamic and constantly evolving concept of digital exclusion that encompasses numerous dimensions and levels. The ``usage access gap'' and the ``second-level divide'' both account for differences in how digitally divided people actually use technology. In this study, we employ social cognitive theory as a framework to explore the impact of various kinds of technology usage on predominately minority students' technology and application self-efficacy. Data were gathered over the course of a large-scale computing intervention that took place in an elementary school district in the southeastern United States. Results indicate that usage access gap activities and second-level divide activities, such as playing games or talking to friends online, may actually help increase students' technology self-efficacy and computer application self-efficacy. Entertainment and social networking activities provide students with positive direct experiences with technology, which may help close this dimension/level of the digital divide over time. Future computing interventions should consider establishing dedicated ``computer recess'' time to help digitally divided students increase their technology self-efficacy.},

We test our hypotheses using multi-level modeling and a large scale multinational dataset covering responses of {$>$}26,000 consumers from 21 countries. The results show that perceived personal economic situation mediates the relationship between type of internet access (regular vs. mobile) and life satisfaction; the positive effect of mobile internet use is weaker for ethnic minority than for majority consumers and stronger in poorer than in richer countries. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications for marketing and public policy.},

Schools, peers, and home learning environments are important sources for the development of positive self-efficacy. Expanding on previous research, we investigated the associations between different aspects of the digital home learning environment and students' ICT self-efficacy. The moderation effects of gender were also tested. A total of 651 children answered a questionnaire about different digital home learning environment dimensions and estimated their ICT self-efficacy using an adapted scale---Schwarzer and Jerusalem's (1999) general self-efficacy scale. Using the structural equation modeling technique, a digital home learning environment containing six different qualities of parental support was investigated. Families' cultural capital, parents' attitudes toward the Internet, and shared Internet activities at home contributed positively to ICT self-efficacy. We observed small gender differences, with the moderation effect being nonsignificant. The results help researchers and practitioners to understand how different dimensions of the digital home learning environment support ICT self-efficacy. We will discuss how parents can enhance the home learning environment and how teachers can integrate this knowledge into formal education.},

The last meta-analysis on this issue covered the empirical studies up to about 20 years ago. Since then, technology use has increased exponentially, and many more empirical studies have examined this issue, but showed inconsistent findings. As a result, there is a lack of clear understanding about if such gender difference still persists. The purpose of this research is to re-examine this issue by meta-analyzing the empirical research studies on this issue in the last two decades, and to examine the potential moderators that may have contributed to the heterogeneity of the research findings. A total of 50 articles from 1997 to 2014 were identified and used in this meta-analysis. The findings indicated that males still hold more favorable attitudes toward technology use than females, but such different would be characterized as small effect sizes. The comparison between this study and the last meta-analysis of about two decades ago suggested that there was only minimal reduction in the gender attitudinal gap in general. But when the general attitude was broken down to different dimensions of attitude, the present study showed a reduction of gender difference in the dimension of Affect and Self-efficacy, but not in the dimension of Belief. The limitations of the study were noted, and the implications and future research directions were discussed.},

  abstract = {The digital gender divide is one of the most critical issues in education today. Digital gender gaps can exist in students' access to and use of ICT, attitudes toward technology, and digital knowledge and skills. However, previous research has primarily examined these divides in isolation and largely ignored their interdependencies. Using student data from the 2013 and 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS), this study examines how these gaps are related. Specifically, we synthesize evidence on gender gaps in digital knowledge and skills, controlling for differences in ICT access and technology attitudes. In addition, we examine the role that technology attitudes play in the gender gap in digital knowledge and skills. Our findings suggest that (a) girls outperform boys in digital knowledge and skills (\$\${\textbackslash}upbeta\$\$= -0.11 to -0.29); (b) gender differences in attitudes toward technology partially explain gender differences in digital knowledge and skills; (c) the variability within and between countries in the gender gap in students' digital skills is partly explained by the type of digital skill and the country's socio-economic development and gender inequality. Overall, this research shows a relationship between the gender gaps in students' digital knowledge and skills and the gender gaps in students' attitudes toward technology. We conclude that the first- and second-level gender digital divides are connected.},

The present work analyzes the relationship between self-concept, self-efficacy, and subjective well-being in native and migrant adolescents in Santiago de Chile. The sample consisted of 406 students, 56.65\% women, with an age range that fluctuated between 12 and 16 years, with an average of 13.36 years ({$<$}italic{$>$}SD{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 0.96). Student's {$<$}italic{$>$}t{$<$}/italic{$>$}-tests were used to compare the average of the constructs evaluated between natives/migrants and boys/girls participants. Subsequently, two multivariate models of simple mediation were constructed, one for natives and another for migrants, which assumed subjective well-being as a dependent variable, academic self-concept as an independent variable and the general self-efficacy as a mediating variable. In both models, gender was considered as a control variable. Results show that migrant students present higher levels of academic self-concept and general self-efficacy than native students. There are no differences with regard to well-being. In the case of gender, differences are observed only for the case of general self-efficacy, where boys present higher levels. On the other hand, a partial mediation is observed for the model of native students and a total mediation for the model of migrant students. The study yielded interesting results regarding the differences in the evaluation of the constructs of self-concept, self-efficacy, and subjective well-being in both groups. Such data can be used as inputs for the development of public policies for adolescents.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The digital divide between countries is a critical phenomenon separating the countries that 'have' (mostly developed countries) from the countries that 'have not' (mostly developing countries). It places develop-ing countries in a disadvantaged position economically, politically, and socially that in turns affects the life and social well-being of the citizens. Current understanding of the digital divide is limited by usage of sec-ondary data, which prompts scholars to call for more theoretically-based empirical research. Since the key to reducing the digital divide is to increase people's access to ICT, this study developed and empiri-cally tested a 3-tier ICT access model to determine the effect on ICT development of intention to par-ticipate in online activities among citizens in developed and developing countries. The model was founded on three existing research frameworks. In addition, this study theoretically clarified the relationship between four types of ICT access and how they contribute to intention to participate online. Survey data of university students from Korea and Cambodia was collected. The results confirm the effect of ICT development on citizens' intention and isolate key factors that impact the two countries differently. Tech-nological access was found to impact extrinsic motivational access and skills access. Social access influ-enced extrinsic and intrinsic motivational access and skills access. Implications for research and practice are discussed. A country's development index plays an important role in affecting the digital divide.}

  abstract = {In this digital era, information and communication technology (ICT) has become an essential component of school education. Students' self-efficacy in using ICT has been shown to contribute to their ICT literacy. However, research on the correlates of ICT self-efficacy has been insufficient, resulting in often oversimplified causal statements. This study investigated the relationship between adolescents' interest in ICT and their ICT self-efficacy at age fifteen based on data from 30 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries that participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. Altogether, the participants include 201,652 students from 7708 schools, all of whom completed the ICT Familiarity Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using multilevel mediation, with interest in ICT as the independent variable, perceived ICT competence at age fifteen as the dependent variable, and several ICT-related behavioral factors, including ICT use at school (USESCH), ICT use outside of school for schoolwork (HOMESCH), ICT use outside of school for leisure (ENTUSE), and ICT use in social interaction (SOIAICT), as the mediating variables. The results showed a significantly positive relationship between adolescents' interest in ICT and their ICT self-efficacy at age fifteen and that this relationship was partially mediated by behavioral factors. ICT use at home and ICT use at school were not significant mediators for any of the 30 OECD countries while ICT use for recreation and ICT use for social interaction were significant for most countries. The practical implications of these findings are discussed, and suggestions are offered.},

Prior research on Internet self-efficacy has been limited to examining specific task performance and narrow behavioral domains rather than overall attainments in relation to general Internet use, and has not yielded evidence of reliability and construct validity. Survey data were collected to develop a reliable operational measure of Internet self-efficacy and to examine its construct validity. An eight-item Internet self-efficacy scale developed for the present study was found to be reliable and internally consistent. Prior Internet experience, outcome expectancies and Internet use were significantly and positively correlated to Internet self-efficacy judgments. Internet stress and self-disparagement were negatively related to Internet self-efficacy.

  abstract = {Over the years, a variety of frameworks, models and literacies have been developed to guide teacher educators in their efforts to build digital capabilities in their students, that will support them to use new and emerging technologies in their future classrooms. Generally, these focus on advancing students' skills in using `educational' applications and digitally-sourced information, or understanding effective blends of pedagogical, content and technological knowledge seen as supporting the integration of digital resources into teaching, to enhance subject learning outcomes. Within teacher education institutions courses developing these capabilities are commonly delivered as standalone entities, or there is an assumption that they will be generated by technology's integration in other disciplines or through mandated assessment. However, significant research exists suggesting the current narrow focus on subject-related technical and information skills does not prepare students adequately with the breadth of knowledge and capabilities needed in today's classrooms, and beyond. This article presents a conceptual framework introducing an expanded view of teacher digital competence (TDC). It moves beyond prevailing technical and literacies conceptualisations, arguing for more holistic and broader-based understandings that recognise the increasingly complex knowledge and skills young people need to function ethically, safely and productively in diverse, digitally-mediated environments. The implications of the framework are discussed, with specific reference to its interdisciplinary nature and the requirement of all faculty to engage purposefully and deliberately in delivering its objectives. Practical suggestions on how the framework might be used by faculty, are presented.},

Intriguingly, results from IEA's International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) of grade eight students, undertaken in 2013, indicated that female students generally had higher computer and information literacy (CIL) scale scores than male students. This book further analyzes the data collected by ICILS 2013, providing an in-depth investigation of the gender differences in the CIL abilities of students and their teachers. After establishing how CIL (and other similar constructs) are assessed, this chapter reviews the existing research into gender differences in students' CIL; this is based mainly on data collected by large-scale assessments. Patterns in students' use of information and computer technologies, their perceptions of computer technology, and their sense of competence in using computer technologies reveal gender differences that might be associated with the differing development of students' CIL. Gender differences among teachers, in their confidence in the use of computer technologies and their attitudes to the pedagogical use of those technologies, are also examined.},

An analysis of differential item functioning indicated that female students generally performed relatively better on tasks that involved communication, design, and creativity, while male students generally performed relatively better on more technical tasks, and those concerned with security. Female students took a little longer to complete the test than male students; this may have contributed to their better scores. While there were few differences between female and male students' basic information and communications technologies (ICT) self-efficacy, on average, male students recorded higher specialized ICT self-efficacy than female students in all 14 countries, and the difference was moderate to large in 12 of the 14 countries. General ICT self-efficacy was positively associated with both male and female CIL achievement to a similar extent in all 14 countries. Advanced ICT self-efficacy, however, was less strongly and less consistently related to CIL achievement.},

  abstract = {Two of the groups of potential influences on the development of computer and information literacy (CIL) concern students' affective responses (how they feel and behave in response to those feelings) when interacting with information and computer technologies (ICT) and their opportunities to learn CIL. IEA's International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 revealed that female students achieved better CIL test scores than male students in most of the participating countries. The question then arises as to whether gender differences in the CIL performance of students are associated with differences in their affective responses to ICT and/or differences in their levels of ICT usage. These questions were investigated by analyzing data from the ICILS 2013 student assessments and student questionnaires. Male students notably reported significantly higher levels of interest in, and enjoyment of, ICT than their female peers in 13 of 14 ICILS countries, and interest-enjoyment also appeared to have a stronger relationship with achievement in CIL among male students than among female students. While there may be some gendered patterns of use of ICT that reflect different interests, these differences do not uniformly result in advantages or disadvantages for male or female students in terms of CIL achievement.},

  abstract = {Increasingly more research is exploring how digital media can be used for teaching but is largely focused on how teachers shape technology use. Besides teachers in the classroom, parents at home may also have a pivotal role in shaping students' beliefs towards digital media which are in turn an important precursor to students' use of technology for learning. Previous research shows parent factors are related to students' ICT self-efficacy; however, the underlying mechanisms explaining these relations are less clear. Following Eccles et al.'s parent socialization model (1983), we investigate whether parents' behaviors including modeling and provision of digital media mediate the relation between parents' beliefs regarding digital media and students' digital media self-efficacy. Data were drawn from parent and student questionnaires collected as part of a study to investigate conditions for successful digital media use in classrooms (N~=~1206 students and their parents). Results show while parents' beliefs are related to students' digital media self-efficacy, only parents' provision of smart phones mediates this relation. Findings indicate the importance of parents' beliefs regarding digital media and the need for future research into at home factors that influence students' digital media self-efficacy.},

Students' learning experiences are crucial for the development of self-efficacy beliefs, which may affect students' achievements. The present study explores how self-efficacy can be contextualized with information and communication technology in 15 countries. A theoretical model is built and tested in each country based on data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2013. The analyses show that experience with technology, autonomous learning, and socioeconomic background explain the variations in ICT self-efficacy. Further, gender, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic background play important roles in understanding students' computer and information literacies. This indicates that ICT self-efficacy is positively related to computer and information literacy when controlled for other student characteristics and background contextual variables. The results reveal a clear distinction between ICT self-efficacy and computer and information literacy.},

In order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) goal 4, that is, to ensure quality education for all, to make educational resources and online learning are indispensable, and to access these resources anytime, anywhere through the Internet. In addition, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has made online education more necessary than ever before. Where and how ICT is used may have an impact on the components of motivation, such as self-efficacy and persistence. In this study, we quantified the impact of ICT utilization on the two components of self-efficacy and persistence. The effects of ICT use on both components were analyzed from the data taken from the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) administered to 15-year old students. The results revealed that students who frequently utilized ICT for the purpose of out-of-school learning, particularly for activities related to school projects, exhibited significantly higher levels of self-efficacy and persistence. The frequency of ICT usage for in-school learning revealed no effect on any of the two above components. In addition, utilization of ICT for recreational purposes outside of school showed significantly lower values in the area of persistence. These results indicate that it is important to set tasks that provide a continuum of ICT use, both in and out of school, in order to motivate learners. This has important implications for the design of learning in online education. Furthermore, it suggests that teachers should design exploratory type lessons that focus on strengthening students' desire to learn outside of class.},

In recent years, the age at which children have their first contact with ICT and first use of ICT has been decreasing. This can significantly affect the development of their digital literacy. This study investigates the relationship between the age at which children start using a computer and the degree of their perceived ICT competence and autonomy at the age of fifteen. It proposes a multiple mediator model within which the investigated relationship is mediated by ICT usage, ICT interest, and the degree to which ICT is a part of students' everyday social interactions. The model is then tested using data from 21 European OECD countries. The test results show that children who start using a computer at a later age (after the age of seven) demonstrate significantly lower ICT competence and ICT autonomy at the age of fifteen. The results of the mediation analysis suggest that the degree of ICT usage in the home environment for school purposes or activities seems less significant to the development of ICT competence and ICT autonomy than other studied ICT-related variables.},

The test was based on the revised Finnish national core curriculum for basic education. Based on the results, there was a small, but statistically, significant difference between the genders in the total scores on the ICT skill test. More consequential differences between the genders were found in the item level analysis. As explicit item level analysis indicated, boys tended to get better scores from more technical-oriented items, while girls got better scores from school work-oriented and social interaction-related items. The results emphasize that gender differences in ICT skills are more item specific than general. More importantly, the variation between individuals in ICT skill items was extensive and in all likelihood more influential than the gender difference as such.},

This study employed a person-centered approach to identify distinct subgroups and examined their associations with smartphone use content types. Using a longitudinal design, we investigated 1275 Chinese adolescents (Mage~=~14.22~years, SD~=~1.23) twice in two years. Latent class analysis and regression mixture model were implemented. Six classes were identified. Less use of entertainment and more use of information-seeking and learning types of smartphone content a year earlier were predictors of well-adjusted group membership.

According to Bandura's self-efficacy, enhancing ICT self-efficacy, which might be affected by technology experience, could be a pathway to improving ICT literacy and competence, which should be one focus of medical educationalists. However, there is a lack of suitable measurements of medical students' self-efficacy and a clear understanding of its relationship with technology experience. We conducted a literature review and direct consultation with an expert panel to identify potential items for the ICT self-efficacy scale. Based on the data collected in a survey of 486 first-year medical students in China, the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to confirm the structure of the final version. Furthermore, we used linear regressions to quantify the association between ICT self-efficacy and technology experience measured by the age of first access to the Internet, the age at first ownership of a personal computer (PC) or a laptop, and that of a smartphone. The EFA results derived 15 items of four factors, with 67.02\% of the total variance explained: Privacy and Safety, Differencing, Communication, and Learning and Application. The Cronbach's alphas for the four subscales and the overall scale ranged from 0.78 to 0.89. Regression results demonstrated a significant association of ICT self-efficacy with age at first ownership of a personal computer (PC) and the mediation role of the general self-efficacy in the ICT self-efficacy's association with the age at first ownership of a personal smartphone. The ICT scale developed is a reliable and valid task-specific measure to assess ICT Self-Efficacy for medical students. In addition, enhancing students' technology experience might improve their ICT self-efficacy.},

It uniquely identifies the factors affecting the digital divide that have emerged in recent years (2017--2021) as well as investigate if there are new forms or levels of the divide that have surfaced in recent literature. The findings, based on 50 included studies, show that the factors affecting the digital divide can be classified into three different segments and nine main categories: sociodemographic, socioeconomic, personal elements, social support, type of technology, digital training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events. Out of all factors, education has been linked to the digital divide the most. The majority of recent literature have studied Level 2 of the divide. Also, only one article in the sample has considered the digital divide at the firm level. Findings also show that a new form, type-of-internet access, and two potential new levels of the digital divide, algorithmic awareness and data inequalities, have been identified in the contemporary literature. The results contribute to the understanding and development of the different perspectives of the digital divide concept. They also contribute to the stream of literature on the determinants of the divide and to the social inequalities and digital inclusion literature. This review can be seen as a guide for managers to realize and understand the forms that the divide can take and to delve into their organizational capabilities on the digitalization front and evaluate where further development is needed within their organizations to help diminish the divide.},

Teachers' psychological factors, such as their self-efficacy and attitudes toward ICT use, have been considered influential in implementing ICT in teaching. However, previous studies have focused on small sample sizes or a limited number of countries and have largely ignored the mediation effect of attitudes on the relationship between self-efficacy and ICT use. This study addresses these limitations by using data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) to examine the relationship between these factors. Specifically, the study synthesizes evidence on the mediation effect of attitudes on the relation of self-efficacy and ICT use in teaching, controlling for ICT resources at school and teachers' backgrounds. In addition, the study examines the variation in this relationship across varied educational settings. The findings suggest that attitude significantly and partially mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and ICT use in teaching, with variations across different countries. The country's ICT infrastructure partly explains this cross-country variability in the mediation relationship. This large-scale data research reveals the mediation effect of attitudes mediate their self-efficacy and ICT use in teaching. This relationship varies across ICILS countries and is influenced to some extent by the country's ICT infrastructure, which informs global educational policies to improve ICT implementation.},

Using the Norwegian data obtained from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) in 2013 (N~=~2410 students in grade level 9), we distinguish between self-efficacy in basic and advanced ICT skills and examine the relations to students' ICT use for different purposes (school-related task learning, study purposes, and recreation) and their achievement in a CIL test. The results show that: (1) self-efficacy in basic ICT skills is positively related to CIL achievement, whereas self-efficacy in advanced ICT skills shows a negative relation; (2) ICT use and ICT self-efficacy are positively correlated for some of the ICT use purposes; (3) there is an indirect effects of ICT use on CIL achievement via ICT self-efficacy; (4) this indirect effect holds for both female and male students. Our findings point to a potential mechanism that links ICT use, self-efficacy, and CIL. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.},

Moreover, terms are often not theoretically grounded. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of digital divide determinants. The results show that the third-level digital divide was underexposed. The primary focus is on Internet use. More importantly, the identified determinants show that digital divide research is largely limited to sociodemographic and socioeconomic determinants.},

  abstract = {This meta-analysis synthesized the relation between measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and students' information and communication technology (ICT) literacy---a skillset that has found its way in educational curricula. Using three-level random-effects modeling across 32 independent K-12 student samples that provided 75 correlation coefficients, we identified a positive, significant, and small correlation, r{\textasciimacron}~=~0.214, 95\% CI [0.184, 0.244]. This correlation varied between studies and was moderated by the type of SES measure, the type of ICT literacy assessment, the broad categories of ICT skills assessed, the assessment of test fairness, and the sampling procedure employed. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that students' ICT literacy differs between socioeconomic status groups, thus pointing to a gap in the domain of ICT. However, the relation between SES and ICT literacy was weaker than those reported in other educational domains, such as mathematics and reading. Carefully designed studies and measures for which a validity argument has been crafted are needed when studying achievement gaps in the domain of ICT in future studies.},

The present study investigated such differences by focusing on teachers' computer self-efficacy (CSE), which is conceptualized as their confidence in performing basic and advanced skills in using computers, along with the use of computers for instructional purposes. Analyzing the data from 1208 Norwegian secondary school teachers who participated in the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 by means of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, we found that: (a) CSE can be described by three factors (self-efficacy in basic operational skills, advanced operational and collaborative skills, and in using computers for instructional purposes) which remain invariant across gender; (b) male teachers had higher CSE in basic (d=-1.03) and advanced operational skills (d=-0.49); (c) no significant gender differences for CSE in using computers for instructional purposes existed; (d) teachers' CSE was differentially related to their participation in professional development courses for females and males. The differentiation into three factors of CSE provides a more detailed view on teachers' CSE than unidimensional approaches. We discuss our findings in light of gender differences and teachers' professional development in using information and communication technology.},

Examining these two contexts at the same time, the present study seeks to identify student profiles of ICT use on the basis of the Norwegian International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 data (N~=~2426). In order to explore profiles of ICT use in schools and at home for different purposes such as recreation, study purposes, exchanging information, and social communication, we take a person-centered approach and apply latent profile analysis. These analyses revealed two independent user profiles and showed that background characteristics (i.e., gender, immigration status) and motivational constructs (i.e., self-efficacy, interest, and enjoyment in ICT) play a significant role in determining profile membership. Significant differences between the user profiles in students' computer and information literacy test performance did not exist. Given that the coverage of ICT at home and in schools has increased substantially over the last decades, the identification of user profiles informs teachers and parents about whether or not students exploit these opportunities to the same extent. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although the home environment is considered as a key factor in the acquisition of children's ICT literacy, only few studies have examined the relationship between ICT-related parental beliefs and practices and children's ICT literacy. Moreover, most of these studies, predominantly based on the construct of parental mediation, use self-assessments which are not considered valid indicators of actual ICT literacy. By investigating different aspects of a digital home learning environment, we extended prior research by (a) using an objective test of ICT literacy to examine this question. In addition, (b) we included children's ICT self-efficacy as a second outcome variable, which is an important motivational variable for self-directed and lifelong learning, and (c) to gain a comprehensive understanding of ICT-related parental beliefs and practices, both adolescent and parent perspectives were considered and examined for their predictive power. Using data from 422 children (aged between 11 and 14 years) and their parents, adolescent and parent reports showed medium correlations. The results show that parental ICT values (beliefs about the importance of being able to work with ICT) positively predict ICT literacy while monitoring/supervision (e.g., controlling children's online activities) negatively predicts ICT literacy. According to predictive power, after controlling for gender and students' educational level, adolescent reports predicted ICT self-efficacy (27\%) better than parent reports (9\%), while the opposite was found for ICT literacy (adolescents: 8\%; parents: 18\%).},

  abstract = {The study of gender differences in academic achievement has been one of the core topics in education, especially because it may uncover possible gaps and inequalities in certain domains. Whereas these differences have largely been examined in traditional domains, such as mathematics, reading, and science, the existing body of empirical studies in the domain of ICT literacy is considerably smaller, yet abounds in diverse findings. One of the persistent findings however is that boys consider their ICT literacy to be higher than that of girls. This meta-analysis tests whether the same pattern holds for students' actual performance on ICT literacy tasks, as measured by performance-based assessments. In total, 46 effect sizes were extracted from 23 empirical studies using a random-effects model. Overall, the gender differences in ICT literacy were significant, positive, and favored girls (g~=~+~0.12, 95 \% CI = [0.08, 0.16]). This effect varied between studies, and moderation analyses indicated that the grade level students were taught at moderated its magnitude---effect sizes were larger in primary school as compared to secondary school. In conclusion, our findings contrast those obtained from previous meta-analyses that were based on self-reported ICT literacy and suggest that the ICT gender gap may not be as severe as it had been claimed to be.},

  abstract = {Digital competence and digital literacy are concepts that are increasingly used in public discourse. However, how the concepts are used and how they are defined remains unclear. This paper presents a systematic review of research where these concepts are used in higher education research. The aim is to establish an understanding of referencing strategy to digital literacy and digital competence over time, disciplines, countries, methods and level of analysis. Three databases were used in the systematic literature review: Web of Science, Scopus and Education Resources Information Centre. We delimited the search to title, abstract and keywords in the databases. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed publications written in English. Initially 107 publications between 1997 and 2017 were found, with 28 addressing digital competence and 79 digital literacy. Our review demonstrates that there is a range of definitions used in higher education research. They vary depending on if the concepts are defined by policy, research or both and whether they focus on technical skills or social practices. This review indicates directions for further research in higher education i) do more research based on critical perspectives to avoid commonsensical use of the concepts, ii) take the development of definitions of these concepts seriously iii) avoid cross-referencing incompatibilities and finally iv) engage in critical investigations regarding the legitimacy of policy over research in the domain of higher education research.},

Despite the ubiquity of ICT and higher education's integration of these technologies, studies show incoming students often fall short in their ICT skills. The purpose of this study is to extend prior research to explore the ICT exposure, use, and access factors that influence students' ICT self-efficacy, and to identify any gender- or income-based group differences. Using a two-year sample of incoming first-year students at a public research university in the United States, the study shows significant relationships between ICT access, prior academic exposure, and Internet use on perceptions of ICT skills. The study also finds students are confident in many ICT skills, though student self-efficacy in their content creation skills was limited. While parental income was not found to be a significant factor, some gender differences in ICT self-efficacy continue to exist. The findings, along with movement in higher education towards distributed and electronic learning, suggest that it is important for universities to emphasize and integrate digital content creation into courses and curricula.},

  abstract = {People in educational settings are expected to effectively use increasingly complex technology. One of the most important factors in technology use is computer self-efficacy (CSE). Although frequently assessed, available measures of CSE have various issues. Additionally, there is no current measure that delineates CSE at different skill levels and specifically targets usage in applied fields. Consequently, this set of seven studies describes the development and psychometric properties of two CSE scales that address these issues: the 18-item Brief Inventory of Technology Self-Efficacy (BITS) and the six-item Brief Inventory of Technology Self-Efficacy -- Short Form (BITS-SF). The first study encompassed conceptualization and item development. The second and third studies explored and confirmed the three-factor structure of the BITS (Novice, Advanced, and Expert) in samples of Mechanical Turk workers and college students, respectively. The fourth study examined the multigroup invariance of this factor structure across men and women. The fifth study showed evidence for the temporal stability of the BITS. The sixth study assessed for validity evidence for both scales. Finally, the seventh study used latent class analysis to determine the underlying classes of the BITS-SF. The uses of the BITS and BITS-SF are discussed. Both measures are available at www.bitssurvey.com.},

Using the 2020 Digital Divide Survey in Korea, our sample consists of 6520 native South Koreans and 699 North Korean migrants aged 18 years and older. We examined the three-way interaction of technological self-efficacy and being North Korean migrants in the relationship between the increase in the use of five types of digital technology, technological self-efficacy, and subjective well-being, using hierarchical linear regressions. North Korean migrants were statistically lower than South Korean natives in all types of increased digital technology use. Moderation analysis showed that technological self-efficacy positively moderated the relationship between increased digital technology use and subjective well-being. A three-way interaction showed that this relationship was stronger in North Korean migrants for three types of utilization, networking, information sharing, and life services. A psychosocial approach needs to be taken to digital technology education for North Korean migrants, in light of the potential benefits of technological self-efficacy.},

At the country-level, the study finds a generally negative relationship between the ICT penetration rate of a country and adolescents' digital skills, implying that increased ICT penetration rate does not guarantee that adolescents have more chance to learn and use ICTs. Educational expenditure on secondary education is positively related to digital skills in 2006, but not in 2003. At the school-level, whether the school is~public or private does not elicit impact on adolescents' self-reported digital skills; school ICT access is positively related to students' self-reported digital skills. At the individual-level, self-reported digital skills is affected by home ICT access, adolescents' Socio-Economic Status, gender and their history of using ICTs. The cross-level interaction effect of ICT penetration rate and home ICT access on self-reported digital skills is significant in the 2003 model, but not significant in the 2006 model. The cross-level interaction effect of ICT penetration rate and school ICT access is significant in the 2006 model. The interaction effect of school ICT access and home ICT access is not supported by the dataset of either year.},
