## Why to work with International Large-Scale Assesments?

The digital self-efficacy agenda that has opened up with these discussions has presented different approaches. On the one hand, it has diversified into case studies or small-scale comparative research. On the other hand, there are antecedents that deal with the problem from experiments and qualitative techniques. However, the largest dossier on this agenda is found in large-scale educational issues studies with a survey approach.

In recent years, International Large-scale Assessments[^06_ilsa-1] have become one of the most relevant types of studies in the field of education, thanks to the large amount of data they collect, the versatility in how the data can be treated, and, consequently, the diverse contributions they can provide to the regions.

[^06_ilsa-1]: Hereinafter, ILSAs

The birth of ILSA dates to 1958, when a group of researchers at the UNESCO Institute of Education were very interested in studying educational achievement and its determinants in different countries, intending to enable countries to learn from the experience of others and thus avoid decisions that would produce undesirable results [@husenInternationalResearchVenture1979]. This led to the creation of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement[^06_ilsa-2]. Since then, the IEA has conducted ILSAs periodically. Likewise, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [^06_ilsa-3] has also been a highly relevant organization in promoting the implementation of this type of study, although its inauguration in this field was only in 2000.

ILSAs are characterized by the deployment of their surveys throughout the world, covering various countries and regions. When their results are published, they are usually illustrated in a ranking format, which opens the way to comparisons between the educational systems that were part of such studies. Therefore, the ILSAs are seriously considered in the field of both research and public policy, since those countries that did not obtain good results look at those that scored higher to develop strategies to improve the country in the relevant area. However, there are criticisms in relation to the above, because there could be situations in which a government decides to implement a policy identically inspired by another country, without considering the particularities of its region, which would lead to a probable failure of the project [@johanssonInternationalLargescaleAssessments2016].

On the other hand, ILSAs are usually framed around specific themes, but considering the effects that contextual factors at the country, school, classroom and student level may have on achievement. For this reason, the questionnaires are not only directed at students, but there may also be some that seek to gather information from the school, teachers or family of the main respondents. Because of this, ILSA data are rich in terms of the uses and treatments that can be given to them. From the data structure, statistical analysis techniques of some complexity such as multilevel models or structural equation models, to name a few, could be employed.

## ILSAs on Digital Issues

In recent years, Information and Communication Technologies[^06_ilsa-4] have become vitally relevant to life in society as they are increasingly present in all spheres of existence, due to the dizzying pace of technological development. In this context, a number of questions have arisen as to how young people relate to technology, and whether they are really prepared to cope in an increasingly digitized world.

In this context, the use of new technologies in education is a topic in vogue, due to the potential benefits that their implementation could bring in this area, such as learning flexibility, the creation of new learning and interaction environments, and the transformation of the traditional training scenario, among many others [@caberoalmenaraAlfabetizacionDigitalAlumnos2008]. However, if these technologies are not democratized in terms of access and knowledge for proper use, societies could be more vulnerable to fragmentation in the digital environment [@truccoNuevasTecnologiasInformacion2010].

Thus, digital literacy is seen as a common objective on the horizon by a vast number of countries, which is reflected in the numerous initiatives that have emerged, especially since the beginning of the new millennium, to promote this type of literacy among citizens. Milestones such as the World Summit on the Information Society held in 2003 and 2005, or the i2010 plan carried out by the European Union, have set the tone for joint efforts among countries to promote advances in societies in terms of technology, seeking to promote access to it and the knowledge necessary for citizens to take advantage of its benefits [@echeverriaezpondaTICRelacionesEntre2010].

This growing relevance of digital literacy in society has caused that in recent years the digital issue has become an important part of the ILSA agenda, including questions of this type in their questionnaires, in order to elucidate the conditions in which young people find themselves with respect to their knowledge and skills in digital technologies. In this context, the attitudes and dispositions that young people have towards ICTs have become very important, highlighting self-efficacy in this area.

It becomes necessary to understand the current context in relation to emerging technologies and the skills to benefit from them. At a general level, the ILSAs have established a prioritization of this, which is highly valuable, since, thanks to the global scope of these studies, a panorama could be visualized at both national and international levels, which would consequently lead to the planning of strategies aimed at addressing the weakest points identified thanks to the ILSAs.
